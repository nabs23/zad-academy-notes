#### **1. Seeking Permission to Enter**  
- The guest should ask for permission before entering the host's home and should come at the appointed time.  
  - **Evidence from the Quran:**  
    *“O you who have believed, do not enter the houses of the Prophet except when you are permitted for a meal, without awaiting its readiness. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, disperse.”*  
    *(Al-Ahzab 33:53)*  

- **Commentary by Ash-Shawkani:** This ruling applies to all believers, not just the Prophet (ﷺ). Guests should not arrive early and cause inconvenience by waiting for food to be prepared.

#### **2. Not Overstaying**  
- A guest should avoid staying too long, as this could annoy the host or make him feel embarrassed if he cannot provide more hospitality.  
  - **Hadith:**  
    The Prophet (ﷺ) said: *“It is not permissible for a Muslim to stay so long in his brother's house that he causes him to sin.”*  
    *(Muslim)*  
  - This refers to situations where the host may feel forced to offer more than he can afford.

#### **3. Not Bringing Extra People Without Permission**  
- A guest should not bring uninvited individuals with him unless the host consents.  
  - **Hadith:**  
    Abu Mas‘ud al-Ansari (RA) narrated that a man invited five guests, including the Prophet (ﷺ). Another man followed them. The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
    *“You invited me as one of five guests, and this man followed us. If you wish, give him permission to enter; if not, he will return.”*  
    *(Bukhari and Muslim)*

### **Additional Guidelines for Hosts and Guests**

#### **4. Advice to the Host to Save for Himself and His Family**  
- A host should not sacrifice necessities for his family to entertain a guest.  
  - **Example:** Abu’l-Haytham hosted the Prophet (ﷺ) and companions by serving dates and slaughtering an animal, but the Prophet (ﷺ) advised him: *“Do not slaughter any milk-giving sheep.”* *(Muslim)*  

---

#### **5. Offering Supplication for the Host**  
- It is recommended for guests to pray for their host.  
  - **Hadith:** The Prophet (ﷺ) made this supplication for Sa‘d ibn Ubadah (RA):  
    *“May fasting people break their fast in your house, may the righteous eat your food, and may the angels send blessings upon you.”*  
    *(Ahmad, Abu Dawud, An-Nasai)*  

---

#### **6. Avoiding Intrusion into the Host’s Privacy**  
- Guests must respect the privacy of the household.  
  - **Hadith:** Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (RA) rebuked someone who looked at a woman in the house, saying: *“If your eyes were to be put out, that would be better for you.”* *(Bukhari and Al-Adab al-Mufrad)*

### **Issues Related to Hospitality**

1. **Hospitality Duration**  
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
     *“His (the guest’s) right is one day and one night, and hospitality is to be offered for three days; anything more than that is charity.”* *(Bukhari and Muslim)*  
   - The first day requires special attention, and for the second and third days, the host may offer what is available. Beyond three days, offering hospitality becomes optional charity.  

2. **The Guest’s Right to Take What is Necessary**  
   - In certain cases, if a host refuses to offer hospitality, the guest may take what is needed:  
     - **Hadith:**  
       *“If you halt with people and they give you what is appropriate for a guest, then accept it; but if they do not, then take from them what is due to the guest, as appropriate.”* *(Bukhari and Muslim)*  
     - **Scholarly Views:**  
       - Ibn Uthaymeen: The guest may take reasonable provisions without the host’s permission in remote areas.  
       - Majority Opinion: This ruling applies only in areas where offering hospitality is obligatory (e.g., villages or deserts).

### **Summary**  
The rights of hosts over guests emphasize mutual respect and moderation. Guests should be mindful of their behavior to avoid burdening or embarrassing the host, while hosts are encouraged to offer hospitality generously within their means. Both parties are urged to uphold the principles of kindness and consideration for one another.
