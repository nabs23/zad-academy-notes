#### **The Rights of the Sahabah (رضي الله عنهم)**  
1. **Believing in Their Virtue and That They Are the Best of Mankind After the Prophets**:  
   - Allah (ﷻ) praised the Muhajirun and Ansar:  
     *“For the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their properties, seeking bounty from Allah and [His] approval...”*  
     *(Surah Al-Hashr 59:8)*

   - The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
     *“The best of the people are my generation, then those who come after them, then those who come after them.”*  
     *(Bukhari and Muslim)*  

2. **Testifying That Specific Sahabah Will Be in Paradise**:  
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) named ten Sahabah who were guaranteed Paradise, known as *Al-Asharah Al-Mubasharun*:

     *(Ahmad, Abu Dawood, At-Tirmidhi)*  

3. **Believing in Their Order of Virtue According to Their Status as Caliphs**:  
   - The most virtuous among them are Abu Bakr, followed by Umar, Uthman, and Ali (رضي الله عنهم).  
   - This order is agreed upon by Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah.  

4. **Loving and Praising Them**:  
   - At-Tahawi (رحمه الله) said:  
     *“We love the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), but we do not go to extremes in loving them, nor do we disavow any one of them.”*

   - Allah (ﷻ) says:  
     *“Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith.”*

6. **Not Reviling Them or Criticizing Them**:  
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
     *“Do not impugn my Companions. If one of you were to spend the like of Mount Uhud in gold, it would not equal the mudd (handful) given by one of them or even half of that.”*  
     *(Bukhari and Muslim)*  

7. **Denouncing and Disavowing Those Who Impugn Them**:

   - Allah (ﷻ) says:  
     *“And the first forerunners [in the faith] among the Muhajirun and the Ansar and those who followed them with good conduct...”*  
     *(Surah At-Tawbah 9:100)*  
   - Ibn Hajar said:  
     *“Ahlus-Sunnah agree that the Sahabah were people of integrity, and none disagrees with that except deviant innovators.”*  

9. **Emulating Their Example**:  
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
     *“I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the rightly guided caliphs. Hold fast to it and cling to it firmly.”*  
     *(Abu Dawood and At-Tirmidhi)*

#### **Consequences of Impugning the Sahabah**  
1. Undermining the foundations of Islam, as they were the primary transmitters of the Qur'an and Sunnah.  
2. Falling into deviation, as criticism of the Sahabah implies rejection of the Prophet’s companions and their sacrifices for Islam.  
3. Risk of disbelief (kufr) and hypocrisy for those who hate or curse the Sahabah, as per the warnings in the Sunnah.
