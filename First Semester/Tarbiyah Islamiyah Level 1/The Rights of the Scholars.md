##### **Definition and Importance**  
- **Definition**: Scholars are the heirs of the Prophets, entrusted by Allah to preserve, teach, and protect the religion of Islam and the laws of Sharia.  
- **Importance**:  
  - When a scholar dies, a gap in knowledge and leadership is created that cannot easily be filled.  
  - Scholars guide the ummah from ignorance to knowledge and from disobedience to righteousness.  
  - Allah (ﷻ) says:  
    *“Say, are those who know equal to those who do not know?”*  
    *(Surah Az-Zumar 39:9)*  
  - The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
    *“He is not part of my ummah who does not show respect to our elders, compassion to our young, and recognize the status of our scholars.”*  
    *(Ahmad, sahih by Al-Albani)*

#### **The Rights of the Scholars**  
1. **Respecting and Honoring Them**:  
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
     *“Indeed part of venerating Allah is honoring the grey-haired Muslim, the reciter of the Qur'an who does not go to extremes, and honoring the just ruler.”*  
     *(Abu Dawood, hasan by Al-Albani)*  
   - Example: Ibn Abbas (رضي الله عنه) refrained from asking Umar ibn Al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه) questions out of awe and respect.  

2. **Loving and Supporting Them as Allies**:  
   - Ibn Abi’l-Izz Al-Hanafi (رحمه الله) said:  
     *“It is obligatory upon every Muslim to take Allah, His Messenger, and the scholars as allies.”*  

3. **Praying for Them**:  
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
     *“Allah, His angels, and all creatures in the heavens and earth pray for the one who teaches people good.”*  
     *(Tirmidhi, sahih)*  

4. **Seeking Their Advice in Times of Difficulty**:  
   - Allah (ﷻ) says:  
     *“So ask the people of the message if you do not know.”*  
     *(Surah An-Nahl 16:43)*  

5. **Obeying Their Rulings That Are Right and Proper**:  
   - Allah (ﷻ) says:  
     *“O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you.”*  
     *(Surah An-Nisa 4:59)*  

6. **Consulting Them and Giving Them Precedence**:  
   - Ibn Abbas (رضي الله عنه) narrated that Umar (رضي الله عنه) frequently consulted scholars, even young ones, regarding important matters. *(Bukhari)*  

7. **Thinking Positively of Them**:  
   - Allah (ﷻ) says:  
     *“Avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin.”*  
     *(Surah Al-Hujurat 49:12)*  

8. **Showing Sincerity Toward Them**:  
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
     *“Religion is sincerity to Allah, His Messenger, the leaders of the Muslims, and their common folk.”*  
     *(Muslim)*  

9. **Defending Their Honor and Reputation**:  
   - Imam Ahmad (رحمه الله) said:  
     *“If you see a man speaking ill of a scholar, then be suspicious of his Islam.”*  
   - Ibn Asakir (رحمه الله) said:  
     *“The flesh of the scholars is poisoned. Speaking ill of them is a serious matter, and Allah exposes those who tarnish their reputation.”*

#### **Guidelines for Scholars’ Mistakes**  
1. **Scholars Are Not Infallible**:  
   - Infallibility is only for the Prophets.  
   - Scholars may err, but their mistakes do not justify tarnishing their reputation.  

2. **Striving for Truth Is Rewarded**:  
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
     *“If a judge strives to issue a ruling and is correct, he will have two rewards; if he strives and errs, he will have one reward.”*  
     *(Abu Dawood, sahih by Al-Albani)*  

3. **Excusing Their Errors**:  
   - Ibn Al-Qayyim (رحمه الله) stated:  
     *“If a scholar is known for his knowledge and righteousness, his mistakes should not be used to tarnish his reputation.”*  

4. **Avoiding Backbiting**:  
   - Backbiting scholars is worse than backbiting others, as it harms the religion.

1. **Undermining Knowledge**: Leads to ignorance and innovation (bid’ah).  
2. **Spread of Evil Deeds**: Encourages misguidance.  
3. **Empowering Corrupt Leaders**: Innovators and bad scholars may assume positions of influence.
