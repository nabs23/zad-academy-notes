#### **Introduction**  
Hosting guests and respecting their rights is highly emphasized in Islam. It is an act of worship and a sign of faith that brings harmony among people and removes enmity. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:  
> *“Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him honor his guest.”*  
*(Bukhari and Muslim)*  

The guest to be honored is the traveler in a city other than his own. Hosting local visitors is virtuous, but the emphasis in Islamic tradition is on accommodating those in need of hospitality, like travelers.

### **Rights of the Guest**  

1. **Expressing Joy in Welcoming Guests**  
   - A host should express happiness upon the arrival of guests, ensuring they feel welcome and honored.  
   - **Hadith:**  
     > When the delegation of Abd al-Qays came to the Prophet (ﷺ), he said:  
     > *“Welcome to the people; you are not to be disgraced or caused to regret.”*  
     *(Muslim)*  

2. **Honoring the Guest**  
   - Allah (ﷻ) mentions the story of Prophet Ibrahim (AS) and his honored guests in the Qur’an:  
     > *“Has there reached you the story of the honored guests of Ibrahim?”*  
     *(Adh-Dhariyat 51:24)*  
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
     > *“Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day, let him honor his guest.”*  

3. **Providing the Best Food and Drink**  
   - Hosts are encouraged to offer the best food and drink available, as shown by Prophet Ibrahim (AS), who hastened to prepare a roasted calf for his guests. *(Adh-Dhariyat 51:26)*  
   - If food is not ready, offering customary items such as fruit is sufficient.  
   - **Example:** Abu’l-Haytham (RA) brought fresh and ripe dates to the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions and then prepared a meal for them. *(Muslim)*  

4. **Respecting Guest Preferences**  
   - The host should consider the guest’s customs and preferences regarding food.  
   - **Example:** Khalid ibn al-Walid (RA) refrained from eating lizard meat, even though it was served to him in the presence of the Prophet (ﷺ). The Prophet clarified that it was not haram but not common in his land. *(Muslim)*  

5. **Serving Guests Personally**  
   - The host should personally serve the guest with humility and politeness.  

6. **Accommodating Guests Comfortably**  
   - Guests should be given a place suitable to their status.  
   - **Example:** When the Prophet (ﷺ) stayed with Abu Ayyub al-Ansari (RA), Abu Ayyub offered him the lower floor for convenience, but out of respect, the Prophet moved to the upper floor. *(Muslim)*  

7. **Providing Sleeping Arrangements**  
   - A host should provide guests with basic needs for rest, such as a bed and a private space.  
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
     > *“A bed for the man, a bed for his wife, a third for the guest, and the fourth for Shaytan.”* *(Muslim)*  

8. **Protecting Guests from Harm**  
   - The host is responsible for safeguarding the guest from harm or annoyance.  
   - **Quranic Example:** Prophet Lut (AS) defended his guests from harm, saying:  
     > *“Indeed, these are my guests, so do not shame me. And fear Allah and do not disgrace me.”*  
     *(Hud 11:78)*
