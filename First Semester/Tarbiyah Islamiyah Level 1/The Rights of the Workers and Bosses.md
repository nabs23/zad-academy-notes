### **Rights of Workers**

#### **1. Fair Workload**  
- Workers should not be overburdened beyond their capacity.  
  - **Hadith:**

    *(Bukhari)*

#### **2. Kind Treatment**  
- Workers must be treated with respect and kindness.  
  - **Example from the Prophet’s life:**  
    Aisha (RA) said: *“The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) never struck anyone with his hand, neither a woman nor a servant.”*  
    *(Muslim)*  
  - Anas ibn Malik (RA), who served the Prophet (ﷺ) for nine years, testified that the Prophet never reprimanded him harshly for any mistakes.

#### **3. Prompt Payment of Wages**  
- Workers should be paid on time and fairly for their efforts.  
  - **Hadith:**  
    The Prophet (ﷺ) said: *“Give the worker his wages before his sweat dries.”*

  - Failing to pay workers justly is a grave sin, and the oppressors will face Allah's wrath on the Day of Judgment.

#### **4. Protection and Justice**  
- Workers must not be harmed or mistreated.  
  - **Example:**  
    Abu Mas‘ud (RA) struck a slave, and the Prophet (ﷺ) warned him: *“Allah has more power over you than you have over him.”* Abu Mas‘ud immediately freed the slave.  
    *(Bukhari and Muslim)*

#### **5. Provision for Workers’ Well-Being**  
- Employers should care for the needs of workers.  
  - The Prophet (ﷺ) personally tended to the well-being of his workers and even looked after non-Muslim workers when they were sick.  

---

#### **6. Allowing Time for Worship**  
- Employers should permit workers to perform their religious obligations, such as prayer and fasting.  
  - **Quranic Verse:**  
    *“Have you seen the one who forbids a servant when he prays?”*  
    *(Al-Alaq 96:9-10)*

#### **7. Right to Rest**  
- Workers must be allowed adequate rest and should not be exhausted.  
  - **Example from the Quran:**  
    Shuayb (AS) told Musa (AS):

    *(Al-Qasas 28:27)*

#### **8. Secure Income and Social Security**  
- In Islam, provisions are made for those unable to work due to illness or other reasons through social security systems like the Bayt al-Mal (treasury).  
  - **Hadith:**  
    The Prophet (ﷺ) said: *“If any believer leaves behind debt or dependents, let them come to me, for I will take responsibility for them.”*  
    *(Bukhari)*

### **Rights of Bosses**

#### **1. Worker Accountability**  
- Workers must fulfill their duties responsibly and not be negligent.  
  - **Hadith:**  
    The Prophet (ﷺ) said: *“The servant is a custodian of his master’s wealth and is responsible for what is under his care.”*  
    *(Bukhari)*

#### **2. Honesty and Sincerity**  
- Workers must avoid dishonesty, cheating, or wasting time.  
  - **Hadith:**  
    The Prophet (ﷺ) said: *“Whoever cheats is not one of us.”*  
    *(Muslim)*

#### **3. Obedience in Work Matters**  
- Workers must obey their employers as long as it does not involve disobedience to Allah.  

---

#### **4. Avoiding Abuse of Position**  
- Workers must not misuse their positions for personal gain.  
  - **Hadith:**  
    The Prophet (ﷺ) said: *“If we appoint someone to some position and we allocate income to him in return, then whatever he takes after that is stealing.”*  
    *(Abu Dawud and Tirmidhi)*  

---

### **Gifts to Workers**  
- Workers should not accept gifts related to their work position. The Prophet (ﷺ) condemned this practice, equating it with stealing from public funds.  
  - **Example:** A man appointed to collect Zakat accepted gifts for his role, and the Prophet (ﷺ) rebuked him:  
    *“No one gets anything of that nature but he will bring it on the Day of Resurrection, carrying it on his shoulders.”*

### **Summary**  
Islam establishes a balanced framework of rights and responsibilities for workers and bosses. Workers are entitled to fair treatment, timely wages, and respect, while they must exhibit honesty and diligence. Employers, on the other hand, are accountable for their workers’ well-being and ensuring justice in their dealings. Both parties must fulfill their obligations to create a just and harmonious working relationship.
