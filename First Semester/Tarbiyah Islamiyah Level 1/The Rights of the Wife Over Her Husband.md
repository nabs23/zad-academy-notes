#### **Introduction**
- Islam ensures that wives are granted rights that maintain their **faith**, **dignity**, and **well-being**.  
- Allah (ﷻ) says:  
  *“And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable.”*  
  *(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:228)*  
- The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
  *“Indeed you have rights over your wives, and your wives have rights over you.”*  
  *(Ahmad and Tirmidhi, sahih)*

### **The Rights of the Wife**  

The wife’s rights are categorized into two types:  
1. **Financial Rights**  
2. **Non-Financial Rights**  

---

#### **1. Financial Rights**  

##### (a) **The Mahr (Dowry)**  
- A gift of wealth that the wife is entitled to receive from her husband upon marriage or consummation.  
- **Evidence:**  
  *“And give the women upon marriage their [bridal] gifts graciously.”*  
  *(Surah An-Nisa 4:4)*  
- **Key Points:**  
  - The mahr is not a condition for the validity of the marriage contract.  
  - If the mahr is not stipulated during the marriage, the wife is still entitled to a dowry equivalent to her peers.

##### (b) **Maintenance**  
- The husband is obligated to provide for the **food**, **shelter**, **clothing**, and other needs of his wife, regardless of whether she is rich.  
- **Evidence:**  
  *“Upon the father is the mothers’ provision and their clothing according to what is acceptable.”*  
  *(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:233)*  
  *“Let a man of wealth spend from his wealth, and he whose provision is restricted – let him spend from what Allah has given him.”*  
  *(Surah At-Talaq 65:7)*  

- **Hadith:**  
  The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
  *“A dinar that you spend on freeing a slave, a dinar that you give in charity, and a dinar that you spend on your wife – the greatest of these in reward is that which you spend on your wife.”*  
  *(Muslim)*  

- **Scholarly Consensus:**  
  - Maintenance is obligatory as long as the wife fulfills her marital duties.  
  - If she refuses intimacy without a valid reason, she forfeits this right.

#### **2. Non-Financial Rights**  

##### (a) **Kind Treatment**  
- A husband must treat his wife with **kindness**, **patience**, and **good character**.  
- **Evidence:**  
  *“And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them – perhaps you dislike a thing, and Allah makes therein much good.”*  
  *(Surah An-Nisa 4:19)*  

##### **Examples of Kind Treatment:**  
1. **Patience With Her Flaws:**  
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
     *“I instruct you to be kind to women, for woman was created from a rib, and the most crooked part of the rib is its top. If you try to straighten it, you will break it. So be kind to women.”*  
     *(Bukhari and Muslim)*  

2. **Being Playful and Sweet-Mannered:**  
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) encouraged men to make their wives laugh and enjoy time with them. *(Bukhari and Muslim)*  

3. **Not Reviling or Cursing Her:**  
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
     *“Do not say offensive or insulting words to her.”*  
     *(Muslim)*  

4. **Teaching Her Religious Matters:**  
   - A husband is encouraged to help his wife learn about Islam and guide her in religious obligations.  

5. **Moderation in Protective Jealousy (Ghayrah):**  
   - Protective jealousy should not lead to suspicion or baseless accusations.  
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
     *“In the case of protective jealousy, there is that which Allah likes and that which He dislikes. As for that which Allah likes, it is protective jealousy when there is cause for suspicion.”*  
     *(Ahmad and Abu Dawud)*  

##### (b) **Equitable Treatment Between Co-Wives (If Applicable):**  
- The husband must be fair in providing maintenance and time to each wife.  
- **Evidence:**  
  *“Whoever has two wives and inclines more toward one, he will come on the Day of Resurrection with half his body leaning.”*  
  *(Ahmad and Abu Dawud)*  

##### (c) **Trust and Avoiding Suspicion:**  
- A husband should trust his wife and avoid unnecessary suspicion or surveillance.  
- **Evidence:**  
  - The Prophet (ﷺ) forbade men from spying on their wives or suspecting them without cause. *(Muslim)*

#### **Conclusion**  
- The rights of a wife over her husband aim to foster love, harmony, and respect in the family.  
- A husband who honors these rights ensures a stable and rewarding marital relationship.  
- **Allah’s Command:**  
  *“Fear Allah with regard to women, for you have taken them as a trust from Allah.”*  
  *(Muslim)*
