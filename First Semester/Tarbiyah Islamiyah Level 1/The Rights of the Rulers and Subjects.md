### **The Rights of the Ruler Over His Subjects**

#### **1. Obedience to the Ruler**  
- It is obligatory for subjects to obey their ruler as long as it aligns with obedience to Allah and His Messenger.  
  - **Quranic Evidence:**  
    *"O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you."*  
    *(An-Nisa 4:59)*  
  - **Hadith:**  
    The Prophet (ﷺ) said: *"Whoever obeys me has obeyed Allah, and whoever disobeys me has disobeyed Allah. Whoever obeys the leader has obeyed me, and whoever disobeys the leader has disobeyed me."*  
    *(Bukhari and Muslim)*  

- **Conditions for Obedience:**  
  - Obedience must be for Allah, not for worldly gain.  
  - It does not extend to sinful commands.  
    The Prophet (ﷺ) said: *"The Muslim must hear and obey, whether he likes it or not, unless he is instructed to do something sinful. If he is instructed to do something sinful, there is no requirement to hear or to obey."*  
    *(Bukhari and Muslim)*  

- Subjects must obey the ruler in times of ease and difficulty.  
  The Prophet (ﷺ) said: *"You must hear and obey at times of ease and of hardship, when you have energy and when you are reluctant, and when others are given precedence over you even if they are selfish."*  
    *(Muslim)*

  - **Hadith:**  
    The Prophet (ﷺ) said: *"The best of your rulers are those whom you love and they love you, and you pray for them, and they pray for you. The worst of your rulers are those whom you hate and they hate you, and you curse them and they curse you."* He was asked: "Should we not fight them?" He replied: *"No, not so long as they establish prayer among you. But if you see something in your rulers that you dislike, then hate their deeds, but do not withdraw your hand from obedience to them."*  
    *(Muslim)*  

- Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman (RA) narrated:  
    *"Hear and obey the leader, even if your back is flogged and your wealth is taken; hear and obey."*
