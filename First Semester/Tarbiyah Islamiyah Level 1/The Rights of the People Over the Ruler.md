### **The Rights of the People Over the Ruler**

In Islam, rulers are entrusted with authority as a trust (amanah) to uphold justice, safeguard the religion, and manage the affairs of the ummah. This responsibility is not a privilege but a heavy burden for which rulers will be held accountable on the Day of Judgment.

### **The Duties of the Ruler Towards the People**

#### **1. Establishing and Protecting the Religion of the Ummah**
- The ruler must ensure that the religion of Islam is upheld, spreading knowledge and safeguarding the religious obligations of the community.  
  - **Hadith:**  
    The Prophet (ﷺ) said: *"The ruler who is in charge of the people is a custodian, and he is responsible for those under his custodianship."*  
    *(Bukhari and Muslim)*  

- **Ways to Achieve This:**  
  - Spreading Islamic knowledge and calling others to Islam.  
    - **Hadith:**  
      When sending Mu'adh ibn Jabal (RA) to Yemen, the Prophet (ﷺ) said: *"Call them to bear witness that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah, and that I am the Messenger of Allah. If they obey you in that, then inform them that Allah has enjoined upon them five prayers every day and night..."*  
      *(Bukhari and Muslim)*  
  - Respecting and consulting scholars for guidance in decision-making.  
    - **Quran:**  
      *"...And consult them in the matter..."*  
      *(Aal Imran 3:159)*

#### **2. Judging Between People According to the Sharia**
- The ruler is obligated to ensure justice by applying the rulings of Sharia and compelling the people to adhere to them.  
  - **Quran:**  
    *"And judge, [O Muhammad], between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations."*  
    *(Al-Maidah 5:49)*  

- **Carrying Out Hudood (Prescribed Punishments):**  
  - Hudood punishments are applied to protect the sacred limits of Allah and prevent transgression.  
    - Example: A woman from Juhaynah confessed zina (adultery) to the Prophet (ﷺ), who ensured the punishment was carried out compassionately and with respect for her dignity.

#### **3. Governing with Justice and Removing Injustice**
- The ruler must govern with fairness, avoiding oppression, and fulfilling the rights of the people.  
  - **Quran:**  
    *"Indeed, Allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice."*  
    *(An-Nisa 4:58)*  

---

#### **4. Protecting the Lives, Honor, and Property of the People**
- The ruler acts as a shield for the ummah, protecting them from harm.  
  - **Hadith:**  
    The Prophet (ﷺ) said: *"The ruler is a shield; the people fight behind him."*  
    *(Bukhari and Muslim)*  

---

#### **5. Taking Care of the Weak and Needy**
- The ruler must prioritize the needs of the weak, widows, orphans, and the incapacitated.  
  - **Example:** Umar ibn al-Khattab (RA) once said: *"If Allah extends my life, I shall certainly leave the widows of Iraq not needing any man after I am gone."*  

---

#### **6. Sincerity and Kindness Towards the People**
- A ruler must be sincere in his role and prioritize the welfare of the ummah over personal interests.  
  - **Hadith:**  
    The Prophet (ﷺ) said: *"There is no leader who is appointed in charge of the Muslims, then does not try his best and show sincerity towards them, but he will not be admitted to Paradise with them."*  
    *(Muslim)*  

---

#### **7. Personally Overseeing the Affairs of the Ummah**
- The ruler should directly oversee the needs of the ummah and ensure their well-being. Delegating responsibilities is permissible but should not result in negligence.  
  - **Hadith:**  
    The Prophet (ﷺ) said: *"Whoever Allah causes to be appointed to a position of authority among the Muslims, then refuses to find out about and deal with their needs and poverty, Allah will not answer him when he calls upon Him in need and poverty."*  
    *(Ahmad and Abu Dawud)*  

---

#### **8. Choosing Qualified Leaders**
- Appointing trustworthy and capable individuals to manage affairs is essential. Appointing unqualified people is considered a betrayal of the ummah.  
  - **Hadith:**  
    The Prophet (ﷺ) said: *"When matters of authority are given to people who are not qualified for that, then expect the Hour."*  
    *(Bukhari)*  

---

#### **9. Being a Role Model for the People**
- The ruler should set a good example by adhering to Islamic principles. The people often follow the example set by their leaders.  
  - **Example:** Abu Bakr (RA) said: *"It will last as long as your rulers remain steadfast in adhering to it."*  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The rights of the people over the ruler in Islam highlight the ruler's accountability to Allah and the ummah. The ruler must safeguard the religion, promote justice, fulfill the needs of the weak, and be sincere and kind in leadership. When rulers fulfill their responsibilities, they ensure the prosperity of the ummah and maintain the balance and justice prescribed by Allah.
