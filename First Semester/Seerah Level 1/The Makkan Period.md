### **How Allah Protected the Prophet ﷺ Before His Mission**  

1. **As a Child**  
   - Born into the **noblest lineage** and from a **legitimate marriage**.  
   - Allah chose him for this honorable status.  

2. **Under Guardianship**  
   - His grandfather **Abd al-Muttalib** (leader of Quraysh) and uncle **Abu Talib** cared for him, ensuring protection and strength.  

3. **As a Young Man**  
   - Allah safeguarded him from misconduct.  
   - He became known for his **truthfulness and honesty**.  

4. **Purity of Worship**  
   - Worshipped **none but Allah**.  
   - Never participated in idol worship or pagan rituals.  

5. **Preparation for His Mission**  
   - Protected from the **promptings of Shaytan** and kept pure, as demonstrated in the **opening of his chest by Jibreel (AS)**.

### **The Beginning of His Mission in the Cave of Hira**  

1. **Seclusion and Reflection**  
   - At the age of **40**, seclusion became beloved to him.  
   - He would go to the **Cave of Hira**, spending the month of Ramadan in worship and reflection on the signs of Allah in the universe.  
   - He was discontent with the idolatry and practices of his people but had no clear direction until Allah guided him.  

2. **First Revelation**  
   - In the cave, **Jibreel (AS)** appeared to him and said, “**Read!**”  
   - The Prophet ﷺ replied:  
      “I am not a reader.”  
   - Jibreel embraced him three times, commanding him to recite. Then he revealed:  
     **"Recite in the name of your Lord who created. Created man from a clinging substance. Recite, and your Lord is the most Generous. Who taught by the pen. Taught man that which he knew not."** (*Surah Al-‘Alaq 96:1–5*)  

3. **Initial Fear and Comfort**  
   - The Prophet ﷺ was overwhelmed and returned home to **Khadijah (RA)**, saying:  
     “Cover me, cover me!”  
   - She comforted him and sought reassurance from her cousin **Waraqah ibn Nawfal**, a knowledgeable Christian who confirmed his prophethood.

### **Jibreel Stays Away for a While**  

1. **Pause in Revelation**  
   - Revelation ceased for a period, causing the Prophet ﷺ to feel deep sorrow.  
   - According to some reports, he sought solitude in the mountains, longing for Allah’s guidance.  

2. **Reassurance from Jibreel**  
   - Jibreel would appear to reassure him:  
     “O Muhammad, indeed you are the Messenger of Allah.”  

3. **Scholarly Note**  
   - Some narrations of despair and attempts at self-harm are not authentic and lack a valid chain of narration.

### **Revelation Resumes**  

1. **The Next Revelation**  
   - After the pause, revelation resumed with:  
     **"O you who covers himself [with a garment]. Arise and warn. And your Lord glorify. And your clothing purify. And uncleanliness avoid."** (*Surah Al-Muddathir 74:1–5*)  

2. **Responsibilities of the Prophet ﷺ**  
   - These verses marked the beginning of his mission, emphasizing two responsibilities:  
     1. **Convey the message**:  
        “Arise and warn.”  
     2. **Personal purification**:  
        “And your Lord glorify. And your clothing purify. And uncleanliness avoid.”
