**Date**: Jumada al-Ula, 8 AH  

### **Cause of the Campaign**  
- The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent **Al-Harith ibn Umayr** to the ruler of Busra to invite him to Islam.  
- On the way, Al-Harith was intercepted and **martyred by Shurahbil ibn Amr**, a leader of the Ghassanid tribes allied with the Byzantine Empire.  
- This act violated diplomatic norms, prompting the Prophet ﷺ to prepare an army for retribution.

### **The Muslim Army**  
- **Number of soldiers**: 3,000 men (Muhajirun and Ansar).  
- **Leaders appointed by the Prophet ﷺ**:

  2. **Ja’far ibn Abi Talib (RA)** – To assume command if Zayd was martyred.  
  3. **Abdullah ibn Rawahah (RA)** – To assume command if Ja’far was martyred.  

If all three were martyred, the Muslims were to **choose their leader.**
