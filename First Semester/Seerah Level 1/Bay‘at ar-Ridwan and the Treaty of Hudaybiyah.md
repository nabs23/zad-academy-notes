### **The Treaty of Hudaybiyah (6 AH)**  
#### **Terms of the Treaty**:  
1. A **truce of 10 years** between Muslims and Quraysh.  
2. The Muslims would **return to Madinah** that year without performing Umrah.  
3. Any Quraysh individual who accepted Islam and fled to the Prophet ﷺ without permission would be **returned** to Quraysh. However, Quraysh were **not obliged to return** anyone who defected to them.  
4. Tribes could join either side as allies.  

#### **Muslims’ Reaction**:  
- The terms appeared humiliating to many Muslims, including **Umar ibn al-Khattab (RA)**, who questioned their fairness.  
- The Prophet ﷺ reassured:  
  "O son of al-Khattab, indeed I am the Messenger of Allah, and Allah will never forsake me."  

#### **Submission to Allah's Will**:  
- The Muslims, recognizing it as Allah’s command, complied.  
- They slaughtered their sacrificial animals, exited ihram, and returned to Madinah.  

#### **Significance of the Treaty**:  
- Though initially perceived as a setback, the treaty marked a turning point for Islam:  
  - It allowed peaceful propagation of Islam.  
  - Paved the way for the **Conquest of Makkah** later.
