  - The Prophet ﷺ actively participated in carrying bricks and stones, setting an example of hard work and humility.  
  - He supplicated:  
    **“O Allah, there is no life except the life of the Hereafter, so forgive the Ansar and the Muhajireen.”**

### **2. Establishing the Bond of Brotherhood (Mu’akhah)**  
- **Initiative by the Prophet ﷺ**:  
  - To strengthen ties between the **Muhajireen** (migrants from Makkah) and the **Ansar** (helpers of Madinah).  
  - The bond was based on mutual support, love, and cooperation.  

- **Significance**:  
  - The Ansar shared their wealth, homes, and resources with the Muhajireen.  
  - Initially, inheritance was allowed between Muhajireen and Ansar, excluding blood relatives.  
  - Later, Allah revealed:  
    **“But those of [blood] relationship are more entitled [to inheritance].”** (*Surah Al-Anfal 8:75*).

### **3. The Covenant of Islamic Unity**  
- **Purpose**:  
  - To eliminate lingering tribal grudges from the **Jahiliyyah** (pre-Islamic era).  
  - To unite Muslims under the banner of Islam.  

- **Effect**:

### **4. Permission to Fight**  
- **Background**:  
  - Quraysh continued to pose a threat to Muslims even after the Hijrah.  
  - Their message to the people of Madinah was clear:  
    - **“You have provided refuge to our man... we will march to you and kill all your men of fighting age and take your women captive.”**  

- **Revelation Permitting Defense**:  
  - Allah granted Muslims permission to fight in self-defense:  
    - **“Permission [to fight] has been given to those who are being fought, because they were wronged...”** (*Surah Al-Hajj 22:39*).  
    - **“If We give them authority in the land, [they will] establish prayer and give zakah and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong...”** (*Surah Al-Hajj 22:41*).
