## **The Stages of the Call (Da’wah)**

The Prophet ﷺ’s mission to call people to Islam progressed through three distinct stages:

---

### **1. The First Stage: Calling People to Allah in Secret**  
- After the revelation of **Surah Al-Muddathir**, the Prophet ﷺ began inviting people to Islam privately.  
- This stage lasted for **3 years**.  

#### **Why the Call Began in Secret**  
- The people of Makkah were:  
  - Deeply rooted in idol worship.  
  - Prideful, arrogant, and resistant to change.  
  - Unwilling to abandon the ways of their forefathers.  
- A secret call was necessary to avoid provoking anger or resistance from Quraysh initially.  

#### **First Muslims**  
The Prophet ﷺ first presented Islam to his close family and friends. Those who accepted Islam early included:  
1. **Khadijah bint Khuwaylid (RA)**: The Prophet’s ﷺ wife.  
2. **Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (RA)**: His closest companion.  
3. **Zayd ibn Harithah (RA)**: His freed slave.  
4. **Ali ibn Abi Talib (RA)**: His cousin.  

Historical records indicate that around **130 men and women** became Muslim during this early period.

### **2. The Second Stage: Calling People Openly**  
- This stage began after the revelation of:  
  **"And warn, [O Muhammad], your closest kindred."** (*Surah Ash-Shu’ara 26:214*)  

#### **On Mount Safa**  
- The Prophet ﷺ climbed **Mount Safa** and called the tribes of Quraysh by name, saying:  
  "If I were to tell you that an enemy was approaching, would you believe me?"  
  - They affirmed his honesty, as they had never known him to lie.  
  - He warned them of Allah’s punishment if they did not believe, saying:  
    "Save yourselves from the Fire, for I cannot save you from Allah."  

#### **Responses to the Call**  
- Many of the people rejected his message.  
- **Abu Lahab** reacted angrily, cursing the Prophet ﷺ, leading to the revelation of:  
  **"May the hands of Abu Lahab perish, and may he perish!"** (*Surah Al-Masad 111:1*).

### **3. The Third Stage: Calling People to Islam Beyond Makkah**  
- The call spread beyond Makkah after the resistance from Quraysh intensified.  
- The Prophet ﷺ began addressing tribes and individuals visiting Makkah during the pilgrimage season, inviting them to Islam.  

---

### **Key Verses in the Call**  
The Prophet ﷺ was commanded to continue proclaiming the message openly:  
**"Then declare what you are commanded and turn away from the polytheists."** (*Surah Al-Hijr 15:94*)  
- He began reciting the Quran publicly and praying in the courtyard of the Kaaba, making his worship visible to all.
