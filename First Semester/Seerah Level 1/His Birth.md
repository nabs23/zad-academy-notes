## **His Birth (ﷺ)**

1. **Date of Birth**  
   - The Prophet ﷺ was born on **Monday, 12th Rabi' al-Awwal**.  
   - Other opinions suggest he was born on the 9th, 8th, or other dates.  
   - His birth occurred in the **Year of the Elephant**.

2. **Year of the Elephant**  
   - This was the year when **Abraha**, the king of Yemen, attempted to destroy the Kaaba.  
   - Abraha led an army with an elephant, but Allah foiled his plan and protected the Kaaba.  
   - This incident is mentioned in the Quran in **Surah Al-Fil (Chapter 105)**.  

3. **Events Surrounding His Birth**  
   - His mother, **Aminah**, saw a light emerge from her that illuminated the castles of Busra in Syria when she gave birth to him.  
   - His father, **Abdullah**, passed away before his birth.  
   - After his birth, his grandfather, **Abd al-Muttalib**, took care of him and his mother.  

### **Benefit**  
- Celebrating the Prophet’s birthday (Mawlid) on 12th Rabi' al-Awwal or any other date has no basis in Islamic texts.  
  - None of the Companions, the best three generations, or leading scholars of Islam approved of such celebrations.
