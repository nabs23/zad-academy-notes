### **A. Allah’s Protection of the Prophet ﷺ Before the Mission Began**  
1. **Born into the Noblest Lineage**  
   - The Prophet ﷺ was born into the **Banu Hashim** clan of the Quraysh, the most respected tribe in Arabia.  
   - He was raised with dignity and honor, reflecting his noble ancestry.  

2. **Protected from Misconduct and Idol Worship**  
   - Unlike others in Makkah, the Prophet ﷺ was safeguarded from:  
     - Engaging in immoral acts.  
     - Participating in idol worship.  

3. **Known for Truthfulness and Noble Character**  
   - Before prophethood, he was renowned as **As-Sadiq (the Truthful)** and **Al-Ameen (the Trustworthy)**.  
   - His impeccable character earned him respect among the Quraysh.  

4. **Heart Purified During the Incident of the Opening of His Chest**  
   - Occurred during his childhood while he was in the care of **Halimah as-Sa’diyah**.  
   - **Jibreel (AS)** opened his chest, removed a clot, and washed his heart with **Zamzam water**, saying:  
     “This is the Shaytan’s share of you.”  
   - This event symbolized his spiritual purity and preparation for his future role.

### **B. The Beginning of the Mission**  

1. **Seclusion in the Cave of Hira**  
   - The Prophet ﷺ frequently retreated to the **Cave of Hira** (two miles from Makkah).  
   - He spent time worshiping Allah, reflecting on creation, and seeking guidance.  
   - This period of isolation prepared him spiritually for the momentous task ahead.  

2. **The First Revelation**  
   - At the age of **40**, during one of his retreats, **Jibreel (AS)** appeared to him in the Cave of Hira with the first verses of the Quran:  
     “Read in the name of your Lord who created.  
     Created man from a clinging substance.  
     Read, and your Lord is the Most Generous—  
     Who taught by the pen—  
     Taught man that which he knew not.” (*Surah Al-‘Alaq 96:1–5*)  

   - Overwhelmed, the Prophet ﷺ returned home, shivering, and sought comfort from **Khadijah (RA)**, who reassured him.  

3. **Pause in Revelation (Fatrah al-Wahy)**  
   - Revelation ceased for a temporary period, allowing the Prophet ﷺ to reflect and long for further guidance.  
   - The pause was also a means of spiritually preparing him for his mission.  
   - Revelation resumed with the command:  
     “O you who covers himself [with a garment], arise and warn.  
     And your Lord glorify.  
     And your clothing purify.” (*Surah Al-Muddathir 74:1–5*)  

   - This marked the beginning of the Prophet ﷺ’s role as a messenger of Allah.
