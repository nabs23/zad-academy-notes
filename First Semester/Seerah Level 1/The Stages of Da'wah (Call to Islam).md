### **B. The Second Stage: Calling People Openly**  
- **Command to Call Openly**:  
  - Revelation of **Surah Ash-Shu’ara 26:214**:  
    “And warn, [O Muhammad], your closest kindred.”  
  - This marked the beginning of the public call to Islam.  

- **On Mount Safa**:  
  1. The Prophet ﷺ stood on Mount Safa and called the Quraysh by name to warn them of Allah’s punishment and invite them to Islam.  
  2. **Abu Lahab’s Rejection**:  
     - Abu Lahab insulted the Prophet ﷺ and rejected the message.  
     - This led to the revelation of **Surah Al-Masad 111:1–5**, condemning Abu Lahab and his wife.  

- **Reaction of Quraysh**:  
  - Mixed reactions of curiosity, rejection, and hostility began to surface as the Prophet ﷺ continued to call people openly.

### **C. The Third Stage: Calling Beyond Makkah**  

#### **1. The Journey to Ta’if**  
- **When**: In **Shawwal of the 10th year of Prophethood**.  
- **What Happened**:  
  - The Prophet ﷺ, accompanied by **Zayd ibn Harithah (RA)**, traveled to Ta’if to invite its leaders to Islam.  
  - Instead of acceptance, they rejected him and incited the youth and slaves to **stone him**, causing severe injuries.  

- **The Prophet’s Response**:  
  - Despite the abuse, the Prophet ﷺ forgave them, praying:  
    “I hope that Allah will bring forth from their descendants people who will worship Allah alone, not associating anything with Him.”  
  - This demonstrated his patience and mercy even in the face of rejection.  

#### **2. Presenting Islam to Tribes and Individuals**  
- **When**: During the Hajj season in the 10th year of Prophethood.  
- **What Happened**:  
  - The Prophet ﷺ approached Arab tribes and individuals to spread Islam and seek protection for himself and his followers.  
  - Many tribes rejected him, but this effort laid the groundwork for future acceptance, especially among the people of **Yathrib (Madinah)**.
