   - It ensures actions comply with Islamic teachings.  

2. **A Sublime Example to Follow**  
   - The Prophet ﷺ serves as the best example for humanity.  
   - Allah commands us to take him as a role model:  
     "There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often."  
     — *Surah Al-Ahzab (33:21)*  

3. **Understanding and Applying the Quran**

4. **Increasing Love for the Prophet ﷺ**  
   - Learning about his life increases our love for him.  
   - The Prophet ﷺ said:  
     "No one of you truly believes until I am dearer to him than his father, his son, and all the people."

   - They serve as role models for later generations.
