### **A. The Year of Delegations**  

1. **Reason for the Name**:  
   - The **ninth year after Hijrah** is referred to as the **Year of Delegations** because numerous delegations from Arab tribes came to Madinah.  
   - They came to:  
     - Declare their **acceptance of Islam**.  
     - Swear allegiance to the Messenger ﷺ.  

2. **Number of Delegations**:  
   - Historical records, such as those in **Sahih al-Bukhari**, state that there were **around sixty delegations** during this year.  

3. **Examples of Notable Delegations**:  
   - **Tribe of Tamim**.  
   - **Abd al-Qays**.  
   - **Banu Hanifah**.  
   - **Najran delegation**: Did not accept Islam but agreed to pay the **jizyah** (protection tax).  
   - Other delegations:  
     - **Ash‘aris**, **people of Yemen**, **Daws**, **Tay**, and **Adiy ibn Hatim at-Ta’i**.

### **B. Abu Bakr (RA) Leads the People in Hajj**  

1. **Delegation of Hajj Leadership**:  
   - The Prophet ﷺ did not perform Hajj this year, as he had only done **Umrah** during the Conquest of Makkah.  
   - He appointed **Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (RA)** to lead the **Hajj** in **Dhul-Hijjah, 9 AH**.  
   - A group of **300 Sahabah** accompanied Abu Bakr (RA), bringing **20 sacrificial camels**.  

2. **Revelation of Surat Bara’ah (At-Tawbah)**:  
   - **Surah At-Tawbah** was revealed during the Hajj, specifically on the **Day of Sacrifice** (*Yawm an-Nahr*).  

3. **Proclamation to the People**:  
   - The Prophet ﷺ sent **Ali ibn Abi Talib (RA)** to make a proclamation in Makkah:  
     - **"No one will enter Paradise except a believing soul."**  
     - **"No one should circumambulate the Kaaba naked."**  
     - **"No polytheist should do Hajj after this year."**  
     - **"Whoever has a covenant with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, his covenant will remain valid until its term expires."**  

4. **Significance**:  
   - This marked a **dividing line** between Islam and polytheism.  
   - It also signaled the completion of **22 years of the Prophet’s mission** of calling to Islam and delivering revelation.
