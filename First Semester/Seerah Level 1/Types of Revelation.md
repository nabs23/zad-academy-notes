## **Types of Revelation (Wahy)**

### **Definition of Wahy (Revelation)**  
Revelation is Allah’s way of communicating His guidance to His prophets. The Prophet ﷺ experienced various types of revelation, which are divided into **six categories**:

---

### **1. True Dreams**  
- Dreams were regarded as the **beginning of revelation** for the Prophet ﷺ.  
- These dreams were always true and consistent with reality.  

---

### **2. The Angel Appearing in Human Form**  
- **Jibreel (AS)** would come to the Prophet ﷺ in the form of a man and speak to him directly.  
- The Prophet ﷺ understood the message clearly.  
- The **Sahabah** sometimes witnessed Jibreel in this form.

---

### **3. The Sound of a Bell**  
- Revelation would come like the **ringing of a bell**, which was the hardest form of revelation for the Prophet ﷺ.  
- During such moments:  
  - His **forehead would drip sweat** even on cold days.  
  - If riding a mount, it would sink to the ground due to the intensity of the revelation.  

---

### **4. Seeing the Angel in His Original Form**  
- The Prophet ﷺ saw Jibreel (AS) in his original creation.  
- This happened **twice**, as mentioned in **Surah An-Najm (53:13–18)**.

---

### **5. Direct Revelation from Allah Above the Heavens**  
- During the **Night of Isra and Mi’raj**, the Prophet ﷺ received revelation directly from Allah, such as the enjoining of the **five daily prayers**.  

---

### **6. Inspiration in the Heart**  
- Jibreel (AS) would inspire the Prophet ﷺ’s heart without appearing to him.  
- Example: The Prophet ﷺ said:  
  “The Holy Spirit (Jibreel) inspired in my heart that no soul will die until it receives its provision in full, so fear Allah and be moderate in seeking provision.”  
  (*Narrated by al-Bayhaqi; classed as sahih by al-Albani.*)
