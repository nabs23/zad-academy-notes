### **Divine Command to Send Blessings**  
- **Allah ﷻ says** in the Qur’an:  
  “Indeed, Allah confers blessing upon the Prophet, and His angels [ask Him to do so].  
  O you who have believed, ask [Allah to confer] blessing upon him and ask [Allah to grant him] peace.”  
  (*Surah Al-Ahzab 33:56*)  

### **The Prophet’s Statement on Salawat**  
- **Hadith**:  
  - **Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-As (RA)** narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  
    “Whoever sends blessings upon me once, Allah will send blessings upon him tenfold.”  
  - This emphasizes the **immense reward** of sending blessings upon the Prophet ﷺ.  

### **Best Form of Sending Blessings**  
- The **best wording for sending blessings** upon the Prophet ﷺ is as narrated in the **Hadith of Al-Bukhari and Muslim**:  
  **اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَعَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ، إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ، وَبَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَعَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيدٌ**  
  - Translation:  
    “O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad  
    as You sent prayers upon Ibrahim and upon the family of Ibrahim.  
    And send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad,  
    as You sent blessings upon Ibrahim and upon the family of Ibrahim,  
    among the nations. You are indeed Worthy of Praise, Full of Glory.”
