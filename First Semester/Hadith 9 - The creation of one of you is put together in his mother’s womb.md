> It was narrated that Abdullah ibn Mas’ud رضي الله عنه said:  
> *"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who was the one who spoke the truth and was believed, told us: 'The creation of one of you is put together in his mother’s womb for forty days as a nutfah, then he becomes an alaqah (a piece of thick coagulated blood) for a similar period, then he becomes like a chewed piece of flesh (mudghah) for a similar period. Then the angel is sent and breathes the soul into him, and he [the angel] is instructed to write down four things: to write down his provision, his lifespan, his deeds, and whether he is doomed (destined for Hell) or blessed (destined for Paradise). By the One besides Whom there is no other god, one of you may do the deeds of the people of Paradise until there is nothing between him and it except a cubit, then what is written overtakes him so he does the deeds of the people of Hell, and thus enters it. And one of you may do the deeds of the people of Hell until there is nothing between him and it except a cubit, then what is written overtakes him so he does the deeds of the people of Paradise, and thus enters it.' "*  
> *(Agreed upon)*
