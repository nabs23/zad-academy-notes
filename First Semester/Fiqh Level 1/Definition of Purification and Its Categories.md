## **Categories of Purification**
Purification is divided into two main categories:

### **1. Metaphorical Purification (Spiritual)**
- Refers to purifying the heart and soul from **shirk (associating partners with Allah)** and **sins**.
- Focuses on:  
  - **Belief (Aqeedah):** Having pure Tawheed (monotheism).  
  - **Actions:** Striving to avoid sins and engage in righteous deeds.  

### **2. Physical Purification**
- Refers to the removal of **physical impurities (khabath)** and **state of impurity (hadath)**.  
- Divided into two aspects:  

#### **a) Purification from Impurities (Hadath):**
- Hadath refers to a state of ritual impurity.
- Divided into two types:  
  1. **Minor Hadath**:  
     - Affects specific body parts (e.g., face, arms, head, feet).  
     - Prevents acts like Salah until **Wudu** is performed.  
     - Removed by performing Wudu (ablution).  
  2. **Major Hadath**:  
     - Affects the whole body.  
     - Prevents Salah and similar acts until **Ghusl** is performed.  
     - Removed by performing Ghusl (ritual bath).  

#### **b) Purification from Najāsah (Impure Substances):**
- Refers to removing physical impurities from:  
  1. **The body**  
  2. **Clothes**  
  3. **The place of prayer**  
- These impurities must be removed for acts of worship to be valid.
