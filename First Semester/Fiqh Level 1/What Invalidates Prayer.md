### **Things That Invalidate the Prayer**

The prayer may be invalidated by several actions or occurrences as outlined below:

---

#### **1. Wudu Becoming Invalidated**
- Purity is a condition for the prayer's validity.
- If the state of wudu (ablution) becomes invalid, the prayer is automatically invalid.

---

#### **2. Contact with Impure Substances (Najasah)**
- If an impure substance contacts the worshipper and they are aware of it during the prayer, they must immediately remove it.
- If removal isn’t possible, the prayer must be exited to ensure purification.
- **Example:** If a person notices impurity on their clothes or body, they must either remove the impurity or end the prayer.

---

#### **3. Deliberately Uncovering the Awrah**
- Prayer requires the awrah (private areas that must be covered) to remain covered throughout.
- Exposing the awrah deliberately invalidates the prayer.

---

#### **4. Deliberately Turning One’s Back Toward the Qiblah**
- Facing the Qiblah is a requirement of the prayer.
- Turning away from the Qiblah deliberately nullifies the prayer.

---

#### **5. Speaking Deliberately**
- Speaking even a single word without necessity invalidates the prayer.
- Evidence: The hadith of Zayd ibn Arqam states that the Companions used to speak during prayer before it was forbidden with the revelation of the verse:
  - **“And stand before Allah devoutly obedient”** [al-Baqarah 2:238].

---

#### **6. Laughing Out Loud**
- Loud laughter during the prayer invalidates it by scholarly consensus.
- This shows a lack of respect for the act of worship.

---

#### **7. Passage of Certain Beings in Front of the Worshipper**
- If an adult woman, donkey, or black dog passes directly in front of the worshipper, the prayer is invalidated.
- **Evidence:** The Prophet ﷺ said:
  - “The prayer will be interrupted if a donkey, a woman, or a black dog passes in front of him unless he places something in front of him like the back of a saddle.” (Narrated by Muslim)

---

#### **8. Omitting Essential Parts, Conditions, or Obligatory Parts of the Prayer**
- Deliberately leaving out an essential or obligatory part of the prayer without a valid excuse nullifies it.

---

#### **9. Eating and Drinking Deliberately**
- Consuming food or drink while praying invalidates the prayer.

---

#### **10. Deliberately Adding an Essential Part or Doing Essential Parts in the Wrong Order**
- Performing additional movements intentionally or disorganizing the required sequence of actions invalidates the prayer.

---

#### **11. Canceling the Intention (Niyyah)**
- Forming and maintaining the intention for prayer is a condition for its validity.
- Canceling or losing this intention invalidates the prayer.

---

### **Ruling on Laughing in Prayer**
- **Three Levels of Laughing:**
  1. **Smiling:** Does not invalidate the prayer.
  2. **Laughing Out Loud:** Invalidates the prayer as it disrupts the solemnity and focus.
  3. **Chuckling (Quiet Laughter):** If it produces two sounds, it invalidates the prayer according to the majority of scholars.
