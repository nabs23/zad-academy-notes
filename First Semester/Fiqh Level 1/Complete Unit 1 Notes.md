     _"Allah intends only to remove from you the impurity [of sin], O people of the [Prophet's] household, and to purify you with [extensive] purification."_  
    (Surah Al-Ahzab 33:33)

- **Najāsah** (Physical Filth):
  - Removed by washing with water until no trace remains.

## **2. Types of Impurity (Hadath and Najāsah)**

### **1. Ritual Impurity (Hadath)**

#### **a) Minor Hadath**
- Affects parts of the body such as face, arms, head, and feet.  
- Prevents acts like Salah and Tawaf until Wudu is performed.  
- **Removed by**: Performing **Wudu**.

#### **b) Major Hadath**
- Affects the entire body.  
- Prevents acts like Salah, Tawaf, and certain recitations.  
- **Removed by**: Performing **Ghusl**.

---

### **2. Physical Impurities (Najāsah)**
Physical impurities must be removed from:
1. **The Body**: Example: Urine, feces, blood.
2. **Clothes**: Clothes must be free of filth for Salah to be valid.
3. **Place of Prayer**: Impurities (e.g., animal droppings) must be removed from the area of prayer.

**Evidence**:
- Allah (ﷻ) commands:  
   _"And your clothing purify."_  
  (Surah Al-Muddathir 74:4)

## **3. Water and Its Categories**

### **Definition of Water**
- Water is divided into two categories:
  1. **Pure Water**: Water that retains its original form without impurities.  
  2. **Impure Water**: Water that has been changed by impurities.

---

### **1. Pure Water**
- Water that remains as Allah created it, unaffected by impurities in **taste**, **color**, or **smell**.

#### **Examples**:
- Water from:
  - Rain.
  - Seas.
  - Rivers.
  - Springs.
  - Wells.

#### **Ruling**:
- Pure water can:
  - Remove Hadath (ritual impurity).  
  - Remove Najāsah (physical impurities).

#### **Evidence**:
1. Allah (ﷻ) says:  
    _"And We send down from the sky pure water."_  
   (Surah Al-Furqan 25:48)  

2. The Prophet ﷺ said regarding seawater:  
    _"Its water is pure and its dead [animals] are halal."_  
   (Narrated by Malik in Al-Muwatta; classified as Sahih by Al-Albani)  

---

### **2. Impure Water**
- Water mixed with impurities that change its **color**, **taste**, or **smell**.  

#### **Ruling**:
- Impure water cannot be used for:
  - Purification.
  - Drinking or cooking.

#### **Purification of Impure Water**:
1. Adding more water until the changes are removed.  
2. Letting the water stand until impurities naturally dissipate.  
3. Treating water using modern methods (e.g., sewage purification).  

**Note**: Purified water becomes usable again.

---

### **Scenarios of Impurities in Water**
1. **Impurity Changes the Water**:  
   - If the color, taste, or smell changes, the water becomes impure, regardless of the amount.  
2. **Impurity in a Large Amount of Water**:  
   - If the water's characteristics remain unchanged, it remains pure.  
3. **Impurity in a Small Amount of Water**:  
   - If no changes occur, scholars differ; the preferred view is that it remains pure.

**Evidence**:
- The Prophet ﷺ said:  
   _"Water is pure and nothing makes it impure."_  
  (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi; classified as Sahih by Al-Albani)

## **4. Rulings on Vessels**

### **Definition of Vessels**
- Containers used to hold water or other items.

---

### **Rulings**
1. **Gold and Silver Vessels**:
   - **Haram**: Using vessels made of gold or silver for eating, drinking, or purification.  
   - **Evidence**:
     - The Prophet ﷺ said:  
        _"Do not drink from vessels of gold and silver, and do not eat from plates made of them, because they are for them in this world and for us in the Hereafter."_  
       (Agreed upon)

2. **Soldered Vessels**:
   - If soldered with **gold**, usage is forbidden.  
   - If soldered with **silver**, it is permissible if the amount is small and necessary.  
   - Evidence: The Prophet ﷺ repaired a broken cup with silver. (Narrated by Al-Bukhari)

3. **Vessels of Disbelievers**:
   - **Permissible**: If their vessels are free from impure substances.  
   - **Conditionally Permissible**: If the vessels are impure, they must be cleaned before use.  
   - **Evidence**:
     - Jabir (رضي الله عنه) said:  
        _"We used to go on campaigns with the Prophet ﷺ and use the utensils of the polytheists, and he did not criticize us for that."_  
       (Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawud; Sahih by Al-Albani)

---

### **Is Purification Valid from Prohibited Vessels?**
- **Yes**, purification is valid even if water is taken from gold or silver vessels. The prohibition relates to usage, not the validity of the purification.
