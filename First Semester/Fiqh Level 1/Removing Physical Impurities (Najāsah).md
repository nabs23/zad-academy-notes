#### **Definition of Physical Impurity (Najāsah):**

- Refers to any dirty substance that Islamic law (Shari’ah) requires to be avoided.

### **Categories of Physical Impurities:**

1. **Accidental Impurity (Contamination of a Pure Object):**
    
    - **Definition**: When a pure object becomes contaminated by an impure substance, such as urine or blood.
    - **Ruling**: The object can be purified using an appropriate method, like washing or sprinkling water.
2. **Inherent Impurity:**
    
    - **Definition**: Things that are intrinsically impure (najis) by nature, such as:
        - Dogs, pigs, donkey droppings, menstrual blood, urine, stool, etc.
    - **Ruling**: These cannot be purified. For example, washing a dog in seawater will not change its impure status.

### **Purifying an Area Contaminated by Impurities:**

#### **1. Contamination by a Dog’s Impurity (Najāsah):**

- The affected area must be washed **seven times**, with the first washing using **dust or earth**.
- **Evidence**: The Prophet ﷺ said:  
    _"The way to purify the vessel of one of you if a dog licks it is to wash it seven times, the first of which should be with dust or earth."_ (Muslim)
- **Scientific Explanation**: Dust contains substances that kill harmful germs and neutralize viruses. However, Muslims adhere to this ruling primarily as obedience to Allah’s command.

#### **2. Contamination by Other Impurities:**

- Washing once is sufficient, but if impurity remains, the area must be washed repeatedly until the impurity is removed.
- **Example**:
    - When a Bedouin urinated in the mosque, the Prophet ﷺ instructed that a bucket of water be poured over the spot. (Agreed Upon)
- **Note**: Physical impurities like stool or blood must first be removed before washing the area.

### **Specific Types of Impurities and Their Rulings**

#### **1. Madhī and Wadhī:**

- **Madhī**: A thin, sticky fluid discharged during sexual arousal.
    - **Ruling**: Impure. It requires washing of the private parts and sprinkling water on the garment.
    - Evidence: The Prophet ﷺ instructed that madhī be washed off.
- **Wadhī**: A thick fluid discharged after urination.
    - **Ruling**: Impure. Requires istinjā’ (washing of private parts) and washing the affected clothes.

#### **2. Baby’s Urine:**

- **For boys not eating solid food**: Sprinkle water over the area without rubbing.
    - Evidence: The Prophet ﷺ instructed to sprinkle water over the urine of a baby boy. (Abu Dawood, classified as sahih)
- **For girls**: The urine must be washed thoroughly.

#### **3. Other Impurities:**

- Human excrement, menstrual blood, urine, and blood from animals not slaughtered in the prescribed manner must be removed by washing.

### **Uncertainty in Identifying the Impure Area**

If there is doubt about where the impurity lies:

1. **Certainty about impurity in two spots**: Wash both spots.
2. **Certainty about one spot only**: Wash that spot.
3. **Likely impurity in one spot**: Wash the probable spot.
4. **Uncertain between two spots**: Wash both as a precaution.

### **Degrees of Impurity:**

Impurities are divided into three levels based on severity:

1. **Light**:
    
    - Example: The urine of a baby boy not eating solid food.
    - **Ruling**: Sprinkling water is sufficient.
2. **Moderate**:
    
    - Example: Human excrement, menstrual blood, urine, and blood from lawful animals.
    - **Ruling**: Requires thorough washing.
3. **Severe**:
    
    - Example: Impurities of dogs and anything they lick.
    - **Ruling**: Wash seven times, the first with dust or earth.

### **Rulings on Certain Substances:**

#### **1. Human Blood:**

- **Blood of Menses and Nifās**:
    
    - Impure (najis) by consensus.
    - **Purification**: Wash until traces are gone.
- **Other Human Blood (e.g., from wounds)**:
    
    - Pure. No evidence requiring its removal.
    - Example: Muslims prayed while bleeding from battle injuries.

#### **2. Animal Blood:**

    - Pure unless it flows during slaughter. Residual blood in veins is tahir.

- All dead animals are impure except:
    - **Fish and locusts**: Pure even when dead.
    - **Evidence**: "Two dead things are made lawful for us: fish and locusts." (Ahmad, Ibn Majah)

#### **2. Insects Without Flowing Blood:**

- Example: Flies, scorpions.
- **Ruling**: Pure unless raised in filthy places.

#### **3. Semen (Human):**

- **Ruling**: Pure. Aisha (RA) would scrape dried semen off the Prophet’s ﷺ garment, and he would pray in it.

1. **Modern Cleaning Methods:**
    
    - Steam cleaning, dry cleaning, or other methods are valid as long as impurity is removed.
2. **Leftover Food or Water of Cats:**
    
    - Considered pure.
    - **Evidence**: "Cats are not impure; they are among those who go around among you." (Abu Dawood)
