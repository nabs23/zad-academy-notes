### **Essential Parts of Prayer (Arkan al-Salat)**

Below are the critical parts of the prayer that are obligatory (Fard). They must be completed in order for the prayer to be valid. If any of these parts are omitted, whether intentionally or accidentally, the prayer becomes invalid.

---

#### **1. Standing (Qiyam)**
- **Obligation**: It is mandatory to stand during obligatory prayers for anyone able to do so. This is based on the verse:
  _"And stand before Allah, devoutly obedient."_ [Al-Baqarah 2:238].
- **Exceptions**: 
  - If one cannot stand due to illness or weakness, one may pray while sitting or lying on their side.
  - Supererogatory (Nafl) prayers can be prayed sitting, even if one is able to stand, but standing is preferable. The Prophet ﷺ said:
    _"A man's prayer while sitting is equal to half a prayer."_ [Narrated by Muslim].

---

#### **2. Opening Takbeer (Takbeerat al-Ihram)**
- The prayer begins with the Takbeer: **Allahu Akbar**.
- Evidence: 
  - The Prophet ﷺ instructed a man who did not pray properly: 
    _"When you stand to pray, say Takbeer."_ [Agreed Upon].
  - The Prophet ﷺ also said:
    _"Its beginning is Takbeer and its end is Tasleem."_ [Narrated by Abu Dawud, classified as Sahih by al-Albani].

---

#### **3. Recitation of Al-Fatihah**
- **Obligation**: Al-Fatihah must be recited in every Rak‘ah, in its proper order, without errors.
- **Exceptions**: 
  - If a latecomer joins the congregational prayer during Ruku‘ (bowing) or just before it, the recitation of Al-Fatihah is waived for that Rak‘ah.
- Supporting Hadith:
  _"There is no prayer for the one who does not recite the Opening of the Book (i.e., Al-Fatihah)."_ [Agreed Upon].

---

#### **4. Bowing (Ruku‘)**
- **Action**: Bowing with the back straight and the head level with it.
- Evidence: 
  _"O you who have believed, bow."_ [Al-Hajj 22:77].
  - The Prophet ﷺ instructed:
    _"Then bow and pause in bowing."_ [Agreed Upon].

---

#### **5. Rising from Bowing to Stand Straight**
- **Action**: After bowing, one must stand straight before proceeding to prostration.
- Supporting Hadith: 
  _"Then rise until you are standing up straight."_ [Agreed Upon].

---

#### **6. Prostration (Sujood)**
- **Action**: Prostration must involve the forehead, nose, hands, knees, and toes touching the ground.
- Supporting Hadith: 
  _"I have been commanded to prostrate on seven parts: the forehead" – and he pointed to his nose – "the two hands, the two knees, and the toes of the two feet."_ [Agreed Upon].
- **Note**: Sujood must be performed with stillness.

---

#### **7. Sitting Between the Two Prostrations**
- **Action**: Rise from the first prostration and sit momentarily before performing the second prostration.
- Evidence:
  _"Then rise and pause whilst sitting up."_ [Agreed Upon].

---

#### **8. Pausing in Every Part of the Prayer**
- **Action**: Allow each posture (standing, bowing, prostration, sitting) to be settled before moving to the next.
- Supporting Hadith: 
  _"When you stand to pray, say Takbeer, then recite whatever you can of the Quran, then bow and pause whilst bowing, then rise until you are standing up straight, then prostrate and pause whilst prostrating..."_ [Agreed Upon].

---

#### **9. The Final Tashahhud**
- **Action**: Sit and recite the Tashahhud in the last Rak‘ah.
- Supporting Hadith:
  Ibn Mas‘ud said: "The Prophet ﷺ taught us the Tashahhud…" [Agreed Upon].

---

#### **10. Sending Blessings Upon the Prophet ﷺ in the Final Tashahhud**
- **Action**: It is obligatory to say:
  _"Allahumma salli ‘ala Muhammadin wa ‘ala ali Muhammadin."_ 

---

#### **11. Tasleem**
- **Action**: Ending the prayer with Salam to the right and then the left:
  _"As-salamu ‘alaykum wa rahmatullah."_ [Narrated by Muslim].
- **Sunnah**: Turn the head enough for the cheek to be visible.

---

#### **12. Performing All Actions in Order**
- **Ruling**: The sequence of the essential parts is mandatory. The Prophet ﷺ said:
  _"Pray as you have seen me praying."_ [Narrated by Al-Bukhari].

---

### **Important Notes**
- **Non-Waivable Parts**: These actions cannot be omitted intentionally, by mistake, or due to ignorance. Omitting them invalidates the prayer.
