### **Tayammum (Dry Ablution)**

#### **Definition**
- **Linguistic Meaning**: "To aim towards something," as mentioned in the verse:  
  *“And do not aim toward (la tayammamu) the defective therefrom, spending [from that].”* (Al-Baqarah 2:267)
- **Islamic Terminology**: Wiping the face and hands with clean earth in a specific manner, as an act of devotion and worship of Allah.

---

### **Unique to the Ummah of Muhammad ﷺ**
- The Prophet ﷺ said:  
  *“I have been given five things that were not given to any of the prophets before me... and the earth has been made a place of prostration and a means of purification for me.”* (Agreed upon)  
  Tayammum is a concession when water is unavailable or cannot be used.

### **When Is Tayammum Prescribed?**
1. **When Water Is Unavailable**:
   - Examples:
     - Being in a desert or remote area without access to water.
     - Water is too far away to obtain easily.
     - Water cannot be found after searching.

   - **Evidence**:  
     Allah says:  
     *“And find no water, then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and your hands [with it].”* (An-Nisa 4:43)

2. **When Water Is Unusable**:
   - Examples:
     - Fear of harm from using water (e.g., extreme cold).
     - Needing water for drinking or survival.

   - **Evidence**:
     - The Prophet ﷺ said:  
       *“Clean earth is a means of purification for the Muslim, even if he cannot find water for ten years. But if he finds water, let him make it touch his skin.”* (Narrated by at-Tirmidhi)

---

### **What Can Be Used for Tayammum?**
1. **Pure Dust or Earth**:
   - Earth must be clean and free from impurities like urine or filth.  
   - **Evidence**:  
     Allah says:  
     *“And do not find water, then seek clean earth...”* (An-Nisa 4:43)

2. **Other Materials** (if earth is unavailable):
   - Sand or rocks may also be used.  
   - **Evidence**:  
     Allah says:  
     *“So fear Allah as much as you are able.”* (At-Taghabun 64:16)

### **How Tayammum Works**
- Tayammum is an alternative to wudu and ghusl but serves as a temporary purification until water becomes available.
- **Benefit**: Tayammum removes the state of impurity (hadath) and allows one to pray.

---

### **Obligatory Parts of Tayammum**
1. **Forming the Intention (Niyyah)**:
   - Intend to purify oneself for Allah’s sake.

2. **Wiping the Face**:
   - Wipe the face with clean earth.

3. **Wiping the Hands**:
   - Wipe the right hand first, then the left.

4. **Doing These Actions in Order**:
   - The face must be wiped before the hands.

   - **Evidence**:  
     Allah says:  
     *“And wipe over your faces and your hands [with it].”* (An-Nisa 4:43)

---

### **Description of Tayammum**
1. Strike the ground with both hands once (scholars recommend holding fingers apart).
2. Wipe the face.
3. Wipe the back of the right hand with the left palm, then the back of the left hand with the right palm.

---

### **Special Cases**
- If there is a fear that the prayer time will end while searching for water:
  - It is obligatory to do wudu or ghusl even if the time for prayer might end. Tayammum is not prescribed in such cases unless there is a valid excuse.

---

### **Finding Water After Tayammum**
There are three scenarios:
1. **Before Prayer**: If water is found before starting the prayer, tayammum is invalid, and one must perform wudu or ghusl.
2. **After Prayer**: If water is found after completing the prayer:
   - Prayer is valid, and there is no need to repeat it.  
   - **Evidence**: The Prophet ﷺ said to a man who prayed with tayammum:  
     *“You acted in accordance with the Sunnah.”* (Classed as sahih by Al-Albani)

3. **During Prayer**: If water is found during the prayer, tayammum becomes invalid:
   - The person must stop, perform wudu, and restart the prayer.

---

### **What Invalidates Tayammum?**
1. **Everything That Invalidates Wudu**:
   - Since tayammum is an alternative to wudu, it follows the same invalidators.

2. **Water Becoming Available**:
   - When one is able to use water again, tayammum ceases to be valid.

---

### **Key Rulings**
- **If Both Dust and Water Are Unavailable**: 
  - Pray as you are without tayammum, as prayer time is more important than purification in such cases.
- **Repeat of Prayer**: 
  - When there is no water or dust, prayer does not need to be repeated later once water becomes available.
