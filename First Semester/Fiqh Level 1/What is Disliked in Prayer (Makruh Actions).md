#### **1. Turning Slightly Unnecessarily**
- **Evidence**: The Prophet ﷺ said when asked about turning during prayer:  
  **"That is something that Shaytan steals from a person's prayer."**  
  (Narrated by al-Bukhari)  
- **Note**: Turning is considered "stealing" as it diminishes the concentration (khushu') in prayer.  
  - **Valid Reason**: Turning for a necessity is not wrong.

   - Completely away from the qiblah.

#### **7. Moving Excessively or Fidgeting During Prayer**
