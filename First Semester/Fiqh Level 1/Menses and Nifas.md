### Menses (Hayd) and Postnatal Bleeding (Nifas) Notes

#### Definition of Hayd (Menses):
- **Linguistic Meaning**: Flowing, such as in the phrase "haada al-wadi," meaning the valley flowed with water.
- **Islamic Meaning**: Natural blood that emerges from the uterus at specific intervals, indicating health and unconnected to childbirth.

---

#### Rulings and Characteristics of Hayd:
1. **Age of Menstruation**:
   - Begins: After the age of 9 years; no record of menstruation before this age.
   - Ends: Commonly ceases at 50 years of age.

2. **Duration**:
   - **Minimum**: 1 day and 1 night.
   - **Maximum**: 15 days (most scholars).
   - **Usual Duration**: 6â€“7 days.

3. **Benefit**:
   - If bleeding is irregular (less than one day and one night), it does not count as menses but remains impure (najis) and invalidates wudu.

4. **First-Time Menses**:
   - If a girl experiences bleeding for the first time, it is regarded as menses if it matches its characteristics, even for less than 15 days.

---

#### Signs of Menses Ending:
1. **Complete cessation of bleeding**: Insert a clean cloth/cotton; no yellowish or brownish traces indicate its end.
2. **White discharge**: Clear liquid emitted after menses.

   **Evidence**:
   - Hadith: Umm Alqamah narrated that women should wait for the white discharge to confirm the end of menses.

---

#### Related Issues:
- **Brown/Yellow Discharge**:
  - Connected to menses: Counts as part of it.
  - After menses: Not regarded as significant.

- **Recitation of the Qur'an**:
  - Permitted without touching the Mushaf directly, especially for a student or teacher, as no evidence prohibits this.

#### Prohibitions During Menses:
1. **Prayer**: Prohibited until menses ends.
2. **Fasting**: Invalid during menses, must be made up later.
3. **Tawaf (circumambulation of Ka'bah)**: Not allowed until purity is achieved.
4. **Touching Mushaf**: Allowed only with a barrier.
5. **Entering a Mosque**: Prohibited if there is a risk of contamination.
6. **Sexual Intercourse**: Forbidden based on Qur'anic injunction (Al-Baqarah: 222).
7. **Divorce**: Impermissible during menses.

---

#### Postnatal Bleeding (Nifas):
- **Definition**: Blood following childbirth.
- **Minimum Duration**: No set limit.
- **Maximum Duration**: 40 days; exceeding this is considered istihaadah (irregular bleeding).
- **Similar Rulings to Menses**:
  - Ghusal is mandatory after nifas ends.
  - Prohibitions during menses apply.

#### Miscarriage:
- If clear human features are present in the fetus (typically at 3 months or 81 days), the bleeding is considered nifas.
- If no features are present, it is not nifas, and regular prayers and fasting must continue.

---

#### Difference Between Menses, Nifas, and Istihaadah:
1. **State of Purity**: No bleeding or discharge.
2. **Menses**: Periodic uterine blood following a natural cycle.
3. **Nifas**: Blood after childbirth.
4. **Istihaadah**: Irregular or non-menstrual bleeding, treated as impurity but does not invalidate prayers or fasting beyond wudu requirements.
