### The Times of Prayer

#### General Ruling
- The obligatory prayers must be offered five times daily within their specific times, as enjoined in the Quran:
  - **Allah (ﷻ) says**: _"Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times."_ [an-Nisa 4:103].
- The timings are derived from the prophetic hadith:
  - **Abdullah ibn Amr (RA)** reported: _"The time for Zuhr is when the sun passes the meridian, and a man's shadow is equal to his height, so long as Asr does not begin. The time for Asr is as long as the sun has not yet turned yellow. The time for Maghrib is as long as the red afterglow has not disappeared. The time for Isha is until halfway through the night. The time for Fajr is from the break of dawn until sunrise."_ [Narrated by Muslim].

### The Time for Each Prayer

#### **1. Zuhr (Noon Prayer):**
- Begins: After the sun passes its zenith (midday).
- Ends: When the shadow of an object is equal to its length.
- **Sunnah**: Hastening to pray at the beginning of its time, unless it is extremely hot. In such cases, delay it until it cools down based on the hadith:
  - _"If it is extremely hot, then delay prayer until it cools down, for extreme heat is from the exhalation of Hell."_ [Agreed upon].

#### **2. Asr (Afternoon Prayer):**
- Begins: When the shadow of an object is equal to its length (end of Zuhr time).
- Ends: When the sun sets completely.
- **Warning Against Missing Asr**:
  - _"Whoever misses Asr prayer, it is as if he lost his family and wealth."_ [Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim].
  - _"Whoever misses Asr prayer, his deeds will be rendered invalid."_ [Narrated by al-Bukhari].

#### **3. Maghrib (Evening Prayer):**
- Begins: Immediately after the sun sets completely.
- Ends: When the red afterglow in the sky disappears.
- **Red Afterglow**: The redness in the sky after sunset, which marks the boundary between Maghrib and Isha.
- **Sunnah**: Hastening to pray Maghrib as soon as the time begins:
  - _"My ummah will continue to be fine so long as they do not delay Maghrib until the stars begin to appear."_ [Classed as sahih by al-Albani].

#### **4. Isha (Night Prayer):**
- Begins: When the red afterglow disappears.
- Ends: After the first half of the night passes.
- **Note**: Halfway through the night is not at 12:00 midnight, but midway between Maghrib and Fajr. Praying Isha beyond this time is considered making up the prayer.

#### **5. Fajr (Dawn Prayer):**
- Begins: At the break of true dawn (when light first appears horizontally in the sky).
- Ends: Before sunrise.
- **Sunnah**: Hastening to pray at the beginning of its time.
- **Aisha (RA)** reported: _"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to pray Fajr and the believing women would attend wrapped in their outer garments. They would return to their homes and no one would recognize them because it was still so dark."_ [Agreed upon].
- **Prohibition**: Delaying Fajr until sunrise is impermissible. Prayers offered after the sun has risen are invalid.
