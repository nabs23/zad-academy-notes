#### Definition of Prayer:
- **Linguistic Meaning**: 
  - The word *salat* means supplication or invocation.
  - Quranic reference: *(And invoke [Allah’s blessings] upon them [wa salli alayhim]. Indeed, your invocations are reassurance for them)* [At-Tawbah 9:103].

- **Islamic Terminology**:
  - *Salat* means worshiping Allah with specific words and movements, starting with *takbeer* and ending with *tasleem*.

#### Its Status Within Islam:
- Prayer is the **second pillar of Islam** after the declaration of faith (*shahadatayn*).
- Evidence from Hadith: The Prophet ﷺ said:
  *Islam is built on five [pillars]: testifying that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, establishing prayer, giving zakat, Hajj, and fasting Ramadan.* (Agreed upon)

#### Virtue of Prayer:
- Many ahadith encourage prayer, highlighting its significance:
  1. Abu Hurayrah رضي الله عنه narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said:
     *The five daily prayers, one Jumu‘ah to the next, and one Ramadan to the next are an expiation for what comes between them, if one avoids major sins.* (Narrated by Muslim)
  2. The Prophet ﷺ gave the analogy:
     *What do you think if there was a river by the door of one of you, and he bathed in it five times a day? Would there be any trace of dirt left on him?* The companions replied, "No trace of dirt would be left." The Prophet ﷺ explained: *That is like the five daily prayers, by which Allah erases sins.* (Agreed upon)

2. **Direct Command**:
   - Prescribed by Allah Himself to the Prophet ﷺ without any intermediary.
3. **Heavenly Revelation**:
   - Commanded in the heavens, reflecting its high status.
4. **Initial Quantity**:
   - Initially enjoined as **fifty prayers**, showcasing Allah’s love for this act of worship.

#### When Was Prayer Enjoined?
- **Time of Obligation**: During the **Isra and Miraj**, before the Hijrah.

---

#### Wisdom Behind the Prescription of Prayer:
- It demonstrates gratitude for Allah’s blessings.

- Strengthens the bond between the servant and Allah:
  - Leads to peace of mind and tranquility.

#### Rulings on Prayer:
- **Obligation**:
  - The five daily prayers are obligatory upon every adult Muslim of sound mind (male and female).
  - Quranic Reference: *(Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times)* [An-Nisa 4:103].
  - The Prophet ﷺ instructed Muadh رضي الله عنه:
    *Allah has enjoined upon them five prayers every day and night.* (Agreed upon)

- **Prayer for Minors**:
  - Children must be taught to pray at the age of **seven years**.
  - They should be disciplined (lightly smacked) if they do not pray by the age of **ten years**.
  - Evidence: The Prophet ﷺ said:
    *Instruct your children to pray when they reach the age of seven, and smack them (lightly) if they do not pray when they reach the age of ten, and separate them in their beds.* (Narrated by Abu Dawud)

- **Ruling on One Who Does Not Pray**:
  1. Denying prayer’s obligation: This is **disbelief** by consensus, as it rejects the command of Allah and His Messenger ﷺ.
  2. Neglecting prayer due to laziness while affirming its obligation:
     - Scholarly difference exists. The stronger view is that it constitutes **disbelief**.
     - Evidences:
       - *(But if they repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, then they are your brothers in religion)* [At-Tawbah 9:11].
       - Hadith of Jabir رضي الله عنه: The Prophet ﷺ said:
         *Between a man and shirk (associating partners with Allah) and disbelief is his giving up prayer.* (Narrated by Muslim)
       - Hadith of Buraidah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet ﷺ said:
         *The covenant between us and them [the hypocrites] is prayer; whoever gives it up has disbelieved.* (Narrated by An-Nasai)

#### Issues Connected to Prayer:
1. **Exemptions**:
   - Prayer is not obligatory for:
     - The insane.
     - Minors (pre-puberty).
     - Women during menstruation or postnatal bleeding.
     - Evidence: The Prophet ﷺ said about menstruating women:
       *Is it not the case that when she menstruates, she does not pray or fast?* (Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim)

2. **Specific Rulings**:
   - If a child reaches puberty, or a disbeliever accepts Islam, and the time for prayer remains, they must pray.
   - The Prophet ﷺ said:
     *Whoever catches up with one rak‘ah of the prayer has caught up with the prayer.* (Agreed upon)

3. **Reverts**:
   - Disbelievers are **not required to make up missed prayers** upon accepting Islam, as Islam erases what came before it.
