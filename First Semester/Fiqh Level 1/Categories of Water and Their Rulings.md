### **Definition of Water**

- Water is essential for **purification (Taharah)** in Islam.
- It is categorized based on its purity and ability to purify.

---

### **1. Pure Water (Tahur)**

- **Definition**: Water in its natural state, as created by Allah, without any impurity affecting its characteristics (color, taste, or smell).
- **Examples**:
    - Rainwater.
    - River water.
    - Seawater.
    - Well water.
    - Spring water.

#### **Rulings for Pure Water**:

- It can be used for:
    - Removing **Hadath** (ritual impurity) through **Wudu** or **Ghusl**.
    - Cleaning **Najāsah** (physical impurities).
- **Evidence**:
    1. Allah (ﷻ) says:  
        _"And We send down from the sky pure water."_  
        (Surah Al-Furqan 25:48)
    2. The Prophet ﷺ said regarding seawater:  
        _"Its water is pure and its dead [animals] are halal."_  
        (Narrated by Malik in Al-Muwatta; classified as Sahih by Al-Albani)

### **2. Mixed Water (Tahir)**

- **Definition**: Water that has mixed with pure substances (e.g., soap, leaves, or dirt) but retains its natural characteristics and purity.
- **Examples**:
    - Water with slight natural mixing (e.g., mud or leaves).
    - Water used for minor tasks (e.g., washing hands or utensils).

#### **Rulings for Mixed Water**:

- It can still be used for purification **if its characteristics remain unchanged**.
- If the water is heavily mixed and loses its natural state (e.g., juice or other liquids), it cannot be used for purification.

---

### **3. Impure Water (Najis)**

- **Definition**: Water contaminated by impurities that change its **taste**, **color**, or **smell**.
- **Examples**:
    - Water contaminated with urine, feces, or blood.
    - Water in which visible filth is present.

#### **Rulings for Impure Water**:

- It **cannot** be used for:
    - Wudu or Ghusl.
    - Removing Najāsah.
- **Evidence**:
    - The Prophet ﷺ said:  
        _"If water reaches two Qullahs (a large amount), it does not carry impurity unless its characteristics change."_  
        (Narrated by Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi; Sahih by Al-Albani)

---

### **Scenarios of Water Contamination**

1. **Impurity Changes the Water**:
    - If the **taste, color, or smell** is altered, it is **impure**.
2. **Impurity in a Large Amount of Water**:
    - If the characteristics remain unchanged, the water remains **pure**.
3. **Impurity in a Small Amount of Water**:
    - Scholars differ:
        - Majority view: It becomes impure even if no changes occur.
        - Preferred view: It remains pure if characteristics are unchanged.

---

### **Purification of Impure Water**

1. **Adding More Water**: To dilute the impurity until its characteristics disappear.
2. **Allowing Impurities to Settle**: Letting impurities naturally settle or dissipate.
3. **Modern Methods**: Treating water through filtration or purification processes.

---

### **Key Notes**

- **The Principle**: Water is inherently pure unless proven otherwise.
- The Prophet ﷺ said:  
    _"Water is pure and nothing makes it impure."_  
    (Narrated by At-Tirmidhi; classified as Sahih by Al-Albani)
