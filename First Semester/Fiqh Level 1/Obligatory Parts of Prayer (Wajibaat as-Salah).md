#### Introduction
- **Definition**: Obligatory parts are necessary acts of prayer but are of a lesser degree than essential parts. 
  - If omitted intentionally, the prayer is invalid.
  - If omitted by mistake or ignorance, the prayer remains valid, but the prostration of forgetfulness (Sujood as-Sahw) compensates for it.

#### The Obligatory Parts of Prayer
1. **Takbeers of Movement Between Postures**:
   - These are all the takbeers apart from the opening takbeer (Takbeerat al-Ihram).
   - **Evidence**: The Prophet ﷺ consistently performed these takbeers in prayer and made Sujood as-Sahw when he forgot them.  
   - Hadith: “The one among you whose prayer most resembles mine is the one who performs these takbeers.” (Narrated by Abu Hurayrah)

2. **Tasbeeh During Bowing (Rukoo’) and Prostration (Sujood)**:
   - In Rukoo’: Say _“Subhana Rabbiy al-Adheem”_ (Glory be to my Lord, the Most Great). 
   - In Sujood: Say _“Subhana Rabbiy al-A’la”_ (Glory be to my Lord, the Most High).
   - **Evidence**: The Prophet ﷺ said: “Say it when you bow, and say it when you prostrate.”  
   - Qur'anic Basis: _“So exalt the name of your Lord, the Most Great.”_ [al-Waaqi’ah 56:74]  
   - Sunnah: Recommended to repeat these phrases at least three times, with ten times being the best practice.

3. **Tasmee’ and Tahmeed**:
   - **Tasmee’**: When rising from Rukoo’, the imam and individual say: _“Sami’ Allahu liman Hamidah”_ (Allah hears the one who praises Him).
   - **Tahmeed**: After standing, the worshipper says: _“Rabbana Lakal-Hamd”_ (Our Lord, to You be praise).
   - **Evidence**: The Prophet ﷺ said: _“When the imam says Sami’ Allahu liman Hamidah, say: Rabbana lakal-hamd.”_

4. **Dua Between the Two Prostrations**:
   - Say _“Rabbighfir li”_ (My Lord, forgive me).
   - **Evidence**: The Prophet ﷺ instructed this supplication between prostrations.  
   - Hadith: _“Say: ‘Rabbighfir li, Rabbighfir li.’”_

5. **The First Tashahhud and Sitting for It**:
   - After the second rak’ah of any prayer with more than two rak’ahs, the worshipper should sit and recite:
     - _“At-tahiyyaatu Lillahi wa-salawaatu wa-tayyibaatu...”_ 
     - This is a testimony of faith and blessings upon the Prophet ﷺ.
   - **Evidence**: The Prophet ﷺ said: _“When one sits following two rak’ahs, let him recite At-Tahiyyaat.”_

### Key Distinctions:
- **Essential Parts vs. Obligatory Parts**:
  - Essential parts: The prayer is invalid without them, whether omitted intentionally or by mistake.
  - Obligatory parts: Can be compensated by performing Sujood as-Sahw if omitted unintentionally.

#### Additional Points
- Tasbeeh in bowing and prostration should be said once at a minimum, but increasing it is encouraged.
- The obligatory parts reflect the balance between fulfilling the prescribed acts of prayer and making allowances for human error.
