## **Wiping Over the Khuffs and Socks**

---

### **1. Definition of Khuffs**  
- **Khuffs**: A type of footwear made of thin leather or similar material, covering the ankles and more, similar to socks.

---

### **2. Prescription for Wiping Over the Khuffs**
- **Evidence from the Qur’an**:  
  - Allah (ﷻ) says:  
    > _"Wipe over your heads and [over] your feet to the ankles."_  
    (Surah Al-Ma’idah 5:6)  
    - When read in the genitive case, the verse implies wiping over the feet.

- **Evidence from the Sunnah**:  
  - The permissibility of wiping over the Khuffs is supported by **mutawatir ahadith** (numerous authentic reports), with approximately **40 hadiths** on the subject.

### **3. Conditions for Wiping Over the Khuffs**
Four conditions must be met:

1. **Worn in a state of purity**:  
   - The Prophet ﷺ said to Al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah:  
     > _"Leave them (the khuffs), for I put them on in a state of purity."_  
     (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)

2. **The Khuffs must be pure (clean)**:  
   - If the Khuffs are contaminated with impurities (**najis**), it is not permissible to wipe over them.  
   - Evidence: The Prophet ﷺ once removed his sandals during prayer after Jibreel informed him of impurity on them.  
     (Narrated by Ad-Darimi with a Sahih isnad)

3. **Wiping is valid for minor impurity (Hadath Asghar) only**:  
   - Major impurity (Hadath Akbar) requires **Ghusl**, not wiping.  
   - Evidence: The Prophet ﷺ said:  
     > _"When we were travelling, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ instructed us not to take off our khuffs for three days and nights, except in the case of janabah."_  
     (Narrated by Ahmad and At-Tirmidhi)

4. **Within the stipulated time period**:  
   - **Non-traveler**: One day and one night (24 hours).  
   - **Traveler**: Three days and three nights (72 hours).  
   - Evidence: The Prophet ﷺ set these time limits in a hadith narrated by Ali ibn Abi Talib.  
     (Narrated by Muslim)

### **4. Time Period for Wiping Over the Khuffs**
- **When does the time start?**  
  - The time period begins from the first instance of wiping after breaking Wudu.  
  - Example:  
    - A person performs Wudu, puts on Khuffs at 9:00 AM.  
    - After invalidating Wudu, they wipe over the Khuffs for the first time at 2:00 PM.  
    - The 24-hour (or 72-hour) period starts from **2:00 PM**, not 9:00 AM.

- **What happens after the time period ends?**  
  - Once the time period expires, wiping is no longer valid.  
  - The Wudu remains valid as long as no new hadath (impurity) occurs.

### **5. Method of Wiping Over the Khuffs**
- Wipe only the **top of the Khuffs**, not the bottom.  
  - Evidence: The Prophet ﷺ said:  
    > _"If the religion were based on opinion, we would wipe the underside of the Khuffs, but I saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ wiping over the tops of them."_  
    (Narrated by Abu Dawud; Sahih by Al-Albani)

### **6. Items Permissible for Wiping**

1. **Socks and Boots**:  
   - Socks (including non-leather ones) that cover the ankles are permissible to wipe over.  
   - **Evidence**: Hadith of Al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah:  
     > _"The Prophet ﷺ did Wudu and wiped over his socks and sandals."_  
     (Narrated by Ahmad and At-Tirmidhi)

2. **Turbans**:  
   - The Prophet ﷺ permitted wiping over turbans in certain cases.  
   - Evidence:  
     - Hadith of Thawban:

       (Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, and Al-Hakim)

3. **Plaster Casts and Surgical Dressings**:  
   - One should wipe over the **entire cast or dressing**, not just part of it.  
   - No specific time limit applies to wiping over these items.  
   - **Evidence**: Hadith of Jabir:  
     > _"The Prophet ﷺ said: Cover the wound with a piece of cloth and wipe over it."_  
     (Narrated by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah; Sahih by Al-Albani)

4. **Women’s Headcovers**:  
   - If a woman cannot remove her headcover due to cold, illness, or other difficulties, she may wipe over it.

### **7. Issues Related to Wiping Over the Khuffs**

1. **Traveler to Resident Transition**:
