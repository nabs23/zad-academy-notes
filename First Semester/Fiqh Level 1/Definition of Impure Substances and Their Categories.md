### **Categories of Impure Substances (Najāsah)**

Impurities are divided into **two main categories**:

#### **1. Major Impurities**
These are substances explicitly declared impure by Islamic law.

##### **Examples**:
1. **Urine and Feces** (Human and Animals):
   - Evidence: The Prophet ﷺ said:  
      _"Clean yourselves from urine, for most of the punishment in the grave is because of it."_  
      (Narrated by Ad-Daraqutni; Sahih by Al-Albani)

2. **Blood (Flowing Blood)**:
   - Flowing blood from animals or humans is impure.
   - Evidence: Allah (ﷻ) says:  
      _"Prohibited to you are dead animals, blood, and the flesh of swine."_  
      (Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:3)

3. **Menstrual Blood**:
   - Evidence: A woman asked the Prophet ﷺ about cleaning menstrual blood. He replied:  
      _"Scrape it, then rub it with water, and then wash it."_  
      (Agreed upon)

4. **Dead Animals (Carrion)**:
   - Animals that die without proper slaughter are impure.
   - Exceptions:
     - Fish and locusts (permitted as halal even if not slaughtered).
     - Evidence:  
        _"Its water is pure, and its dead (animals) are halal."_  
        (Regarding seawater; narrated by Malik and authenticated by Al-Albani)

5. **Pork (Swine)**:
   - Every part of a pig is impure.
   - Evidence: Allah (ﷻ) says:  
      _"...for it (swine) is impure."_  
      (Surah Al-An'am 6:145)

6. **Vomit** (if it fills the mouth):
   - Considered impure due to its similarity to other bodily excretions.

---

#### **2. Minor Impurities**
These include substances not explicitly mentioned as impure but that are considered filthy based on consensus or analogy.

##### **Examples**:
1. **Animal Droppings**:
   - Droppings from animals that are not permissible to eat (e.g., dogs, cats).
   - Evidence: The Prophet ﷺ commanded the removal of droppings from the prayer area.  
     (Narrated by Abu Dawud)

2. **Saliva of Dogs**:
   - Declared impure due to the hadith:  
      _"If a dog licks the vessel of one of you, wash it seven times, the first of which should be with soil."_  
      (Narrated by Muslim)

3. **Impurity of Alcohol**:
   - Alcohol is considered impure by some scholars because it is forbidden for consumption and use.  
   - Evidence: Allah (ﷻ) says:  
      _"Indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan."_  
      (Surah Al-Ma'idah 5:90)

### **Rulings on Removing Impurities**

#### **1. Impurities on the Body**
- Must be removed before prayer.
- **Example**: Cleaning urine or menstrual blood.

#### **2. Impurities on Clothes**
- If impure substances are on clothes, they must be washed until no trace (smell, color, or taste) remains.

#### **3. Impurities in the Place of Prayer**
- The area of prayer must be cleaned.  
- If impurity is discovered mid-prayer, it is obligatory to stop, clean it, and restart the prayer.

**Evidence:**
- The Prophet ﷺ said:  
  _"When one of you comes to the mosque, he should look at his sandals. If he sees any dirt or filth on them, he should wipe them and pray in them."_  
  (Narrated by Abu Dawud)

### **Key Takeaways**
1. Impurities must be removed for acts of worship like Salah to be valid.  
2. Major impurities are explicitly stated in the Quran and Sunnah (e.g., blood, urine, carrion).  
3. Minor impurities are based on scholarly consensus and analogy (e.g., animal droppings).  
4. Impurities on the body, clothes, or place of prayer must be cleaned thoroughly to fulfill Islamic requirements of purity.  

This note summarizes the **definition, categories, and rulings** regarding impurities in Islam.
