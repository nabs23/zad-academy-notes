  - Perform Salah.  
  - Touch the Mushaf (Qur’an).  
  - Perform Tawaf (circumambulation) around the Ka’bah.

**Evidence**:

## **3. Conditions for Validity of Wudu**
To ensure Wudu is valid, the following conditions must be met:

1. **Being Muslim**.  
2. **Being of sound mind**.  
3. **Having reached the age of discernment** (ability to distinguish right and wrong).  
   - Wudu is not valid for a disbeliever, an insane person, or a child below this age.  

4. **Intention (Niyyah)**:
   - Wudu is only valid with the intention of purification.  
   - **Evidence**: The Prophet ﷺ said:  
      _"Actions are but by intentions."_  
     (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)  
   - Note: The intention does not need to be uttered aloud.

5. **Using pure water**:  
   - Impure water invalidates Wudu.  

6. **Removal of barriers that prevent water from reaching the skin**:
   - Examples: Wax, paint, nail polish, dough, etc.

**Important Note**:  
- If substances that block water are present (e.g., nail polish), they must be removed before performing Wudu or Ghusl.  
- If Wudu is performed without removing such barriers, it is invalid, and any Salah performed in that state must be repeated.  

---

### **Specific Cases**:
1. **Dyes, creams, and lotions**:
   - If they do not form a physical barrier, they do not affect Wudu.  

2. **Fake nails or nail polish**:
   - They must be removed as they prevent water from reaching the nails.  

3. **Fake eyelashes**:
   - Not permissible as they block water during Wudu.  
   - **Note**: Wearing fake eyelashes is also prohibited.

4. **Hair implants**:
   - Wiping over hair implants is permissible.

## **7. Being Uncertain About Purity**

1. If one is **certain of being in a state of Wudu**, but unsure whether they invalidated it:  
   - Assume purity (certainty cannot be removed by doubt).  

2. If one is **certain of invalidating Wudu**, but unsure whether they renewed it:  
   - Assume impurity.  

**Evidence**: The Prophet ﷺ said:  
 _"If one of you feels something in his stomach but is unsure if something came out, he should not leave the mosque unless he hears a sound or notices a smell."_  
(Narrated by Muslim)
