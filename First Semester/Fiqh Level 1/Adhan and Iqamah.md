### Adhan and Iqamah: Detailed Notes

#### **Definition:**

1. **Linguistic Terms:**
   - **Adhan:** Means "announcement."
   - Allah says: _“And [it is] an announcement [adhaan] from Allah and His Messenger to the people.”_ [At-Tawbah 9:3].

2. **Islamic Terminology:**
   - **Adhan:** An announcement with specific phrases to indicate that the time for prayer has begun.
   - **Iqamah:** An announcement with specific phrases to indicate that the prayer is about to start.

### **Prescription of Adhan:**
- The Adhan was prescribed in the **first year after Hijrah (1 AH)**.  
- **Origin:**  
  - Abdullah ibn Zayd reported seeing a dream where he was taught the adhan. The Prophet ﷺ confirmed this dream and instructed Bilal (RA) to call people to prayer using the phrases Abdullah heard.
  - Evidence: When Abdullah narrated his dream to the Prophet ﷺ, he said: _“It is a true dream, InshaAllah. Go with Bilal and tell him what you saw, so that he can call the people to prayer with it, for he has a louder voice than you.”_

### **Virtues of the Adhan:**
1. **Virtue of the Call to Prayer:**
   - Abu Hurayrah (RA) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said:  
     _“If people knew what there is of virtue in the call [to prayer] and the first row [of congregational prayer], and they could only draw lots to attain them, they would draw lots.”_ *(Agreed upon)*

2. **Exalted Status of Muadhdhins:**
   - Mu’awiyah (RA) reported that the Prophet ﷺ said:  
     _“The muadhdhins will be the people with the longest necks on the Day of Resurrection.”_ *(Narrated by Muslim)*

---

### **Conditions for the Adhan to Be Valid:**
1. The **time for prayer must have begun**:
   - It is invalid to call people to prayer before the time has entered, except in specific cases like:
     - The **first adhan for Fajr**.
     - The **first adhan for Jumu’ah prayer**.

2. The **phrases of the adhan must be recited in the correct order and consecutively**, as narrated in the Sunnah.

3. The **adhan must be in Arabic**, using the precise wording taught in the Sunnah.

---

### **Stipulations Regarding the Muadhdhin:**
1. The muadhdhin should be:
   - A Muslim.
   - Of sound mind.
   - Male.
   - It is invalid for:
     - A disbeliever, an insane person, or one who is intoxicated to give the adhan.
     - A woman to give the adhan to men.

2. **Sunnahs for the Muadhdhin:**
   - It is Sunnah to:
     - Pause briefly between phrases of the adhan.
     - Face the Qiblah while calling the adhan.
   - No harm if the pause is slightly long.

---

### **Desirable Qualities of the Muadhdhin:**
1. He should be of **good character and trustworthy**, as people depend on him for the correct time of prayer.  
2. He should be **an adult** (though an adolescent reaching the age of discernment may give the adhan).  
3. He should have **knowledge of prayer times** and ensure punctuality in calling the adhan.  
4. He should have a **pleasant voice** to encourage people to attend prayer.  
5. He should be in a **state of purity** (free from minor or major impurity).  
6. He should call the adhan while **standing** and **facing the Qiblah**.  
7. He should recite the adhan in an **unhurried manner**, while reciting the iqamah quickly.

### **Additional Rulings on Adhan:**
1. **Tathweeb in Fajr Adhan:**
   - In the adhan for Fajr, after "Hayya ‘ala al-falah," it is preferable to add:
     - _“As-salatu khayrun min an-nawm”_ (Prayer is better than sleep).
   - Evidence: Abu Mahdhurah (RA) narrated that the Prophet ﷺ said: _“If it is the adhan of Fajr, then say: ‘As-salatu khayrun min an-nawm,’ twice.”_

2. **Innovations (Bid’ah) in Adhan:**
   - It is prohibited to:
     - Add phrases like _“Azizullahi a'zam”_ (What is dear to Allah is greatest).
     - Repeat certain phrases unnecessarily.

---

### **How the Adhan and Iqamah Are to Be Done:**
- **The Adhan:**  
  - Narrated in the hadith of Abu Dawud:  
    _“Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Ashhadu an laa ilaaha illa Allah, Ashhadu an laa ilaaha illa Allah, Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasoolullah, Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasoolullah, Hayya ala as-salat, Hayya ala as-salat, Hayya ala al-falah, Hayya ala al-falah, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Laa ilaaha illa Allah.”_

- **The Iqamah:**  
  - Shortened version of the adhan with the following wording:  
    _“Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Ashhadu an laa ilaaha illa Allah, Ashhadu anna Muhammadan Rasoolullah, Hayya ala as-salat, Hayya ala al-falah, Qad qamat as-salat, Qad qamat as-salat, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Laa ilaaha illa Allah.”_

---

### **Etiquette of Listening to the Adhan:**
1. **Repeating After the Muadhdhin:**
   - It is encouraged to repeat the words of the muadhdhin.
   - Exception: For "Hayya ala as-salat" and "Hayya ala al-falah," one should say:  
     _“Laa hawla wa laa quwwata illa Billah.”_

2. **Supplication After the Adhan:**
   - After the adhan, one should send blessings upon the Prophet ﷺ and say the dua:  
     _“Allahumma Rabba hadhihi-d-da’wat it-taammah, wa-salat il-qaa’imah, aati Muhammadan al-waseelata wal-fadeelah, wab’ath-hu maqaman mahmoudan alladhi wa’adtah”_ (O Allah, Lord of this perfect call and the prayer to be offered, grant Muhammad the privilege and also eminence, and resurrect him to the praised position that You have promised).  
   - The reward for saying this dua is intercession on the Day of Resurrection.

3. **Dua Between Adhan and Iqamah:**
   - Supplications made during this time are not rejected.

---

### **Mistakes in Adhan:**
1. Elongating the first syllable in "Allahu Akbar" to form a question.
2. Elongating the last syllable of "Allahu Akbar" unnecessarily.
3. Adding phrases not prescribed in the Sunnah.

---

### **Key Related Issues:**
1. Recorded adhan is **not valid** for calling people to prayer, as it must be a live announcement by a person.  
2. Women are **not required** to give the adhan or iqamah, as they are not obligated to pray in congregation.  
3. In cases of **travel**, adhan and iqamah should be given even if traveling, as instructed by the Prophet ﷺ.  
4. It is preferable that the **same person gives both the adhan and iqamah**, though it is not obligatory.
