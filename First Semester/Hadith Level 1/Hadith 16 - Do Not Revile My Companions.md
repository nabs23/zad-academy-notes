## Text of the Hadith  
> It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah رضي الله عنه said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:  
> *“Do not revile my Companions, do not revile my Companions. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if one of you were to spend [in charity] the equivalent of Uhud in gold, he would not attain [the reward of] the mudd of one of them, or even half of that.”*  
> *(Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim)*

## Explanation of Key Phrases  

1. **"Spend [in charity] the equivalent of Uhud in gold"**  
   - Refers to giving a massive amount of charity, equivalent to the size of Mount Uhud.  

2. **"Would not attain [the reward of] the mudd of one of them"**  
   - A mudd is a small measure (approximately one handful). This illustrates that the small actions of the Sahabah, done during their time of struggle and hardship, outweigh great deeds done by others later.  

3. **"Or even half of that"**  
   - Emphasizes that even the smallest deed of the Sahabah carries immense reward due to their sincerity, sacrifices, and support of the Prophet ﷺ.

## What We Learn from the Hadith  

1. **The Virtues of the Sahabah**  
   - They hold a unique and superior status in Islam due to their sacrifices, actions, and direct companionship of the Prophet ﷺ.  

2. **Order of Virtue Among the Sahabah**  
   - The best of the Sahabah are:  
     1. The Four Rightly-Guided Caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali رضي الله عنهم).  
     2. The Ten Promised Paradise.  
     3. Those who participated in Badr and Uhud.  
     4. The Ansar and those who gave the two pledges of allegiance at al-Aqabah.  

3. **Prohibition of Reviling the Sahabah**  
   - Reviling any Sahabi, regardless of their role in historical conflicts, is haram.

4. **Conflicts Among the Sahabah**  
   - The disputes and conflicts that arose between some Sahabah were based on ijtihad (independent reasoning). Each party acted according to what they believed to be correct.  
   - These disagreements do not diminish their status or virtue, as their intentions were pure, and they sought to uphold Islam.  

5. **The Role of the Sahabah in Preserving Islam**  
   - The Sahabah conveyed the Quran and Sunnah to future generations. Their sacrifices ensured the spread of Islam, and this monumental role elevates their rank in the Ummah.
