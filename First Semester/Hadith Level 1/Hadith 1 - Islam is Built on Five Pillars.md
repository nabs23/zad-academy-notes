## Brief Explanation of the Hadith
- **The Five Pillars**  
  1. Shahadah - Declaration of Faith: Affirming the oneness of Allah and the prophethood of Muhammad ﷺ  
  2. Salah - Prayer: The obligatory prayers  
  3. Zakat - Charity: Obligatory alms to purify wealth  
  4. Sawm - Fasting Ramadan: Abstaining from food, drink, and other invalidators during daylight hours in Ramadan  
  5. Hajj - Pilgrimage: Journey to the Kaaba once in a lifetime for those who are able  

- **Significance of the Pillars**  
  - They form the foundation of Islam; if any pillar is missing, the structure weakens  
  - Omission of all five pillars leads to the complete collapse of one’s Islam  
  - Denying the obligation of any pillar (for example, rejecting prayer) makes a person a disbeliever  

- **Scholarly Views**  
  - Omission of other pillars (for example, zakat or fasting) does not make one a disbeliever unless accompanied by denial of their obligation  
  - Abandoning Salah altogether leads to disbelief due to clear evidence in the Quran and Sunnah
