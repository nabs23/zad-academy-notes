## Text of the Hadith
It was narrated that Umar ibn al-Khattab رضي الله عنه said:  
*"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say: 'Actions are according to intentions, and every man will have only that which he intended. Thus he whose migration was for Allah and His Messenger, his migration was for Allah and His Messenger. And he whose migration was to achieve some worldly benefit or to take some woman in marriage, his migration was for that for which he migrated.' "*  
*(Narrated by al-Bukhari)*

## Explanation of Key Phrases

   - The intention is the aim or resolve to do a particular action.  

2. **"Migration (hijrah)"**  
   - Linguistically: Leaving one place for another.  
   - Islamically: Leaving the land of disbelief to move to the land of Islam for religious purposes or fear of persecution.  

3. **"His migration was for that for which he migrated"**  
   - This means the recompense of the action will correspond to the intention behind it. If the intention was for worldly gain, the reward is limited to worldly benefit, with no reward in the Hereafter.
