### Text of the Hadith
It was narrated that Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud (رضي الله عنه) said:  
*The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) drew a line for us, then he said: "This is the path of Allah." Then he drew other lines to its right and left, then he said: "These are other paths" — Yazid said: Splitting in different directions — "on each of these paths there is a devil calling people to it." Then he recited:  
 
*"[And, moreover], this is My path, which is straight, so follow it; and do not follow [other] ways, for you will be separated from His way."*  
*(Surah Al-An‘am: 153)*

### Causes of Deviant Groups and Their Characteristics
1. **Ignorance of Islamic Teachings:**
   - As the Prophet (ﷺ) said:  
     *"Allah does not take away knowledge by snatching it away from people, but He takes it away by the death of the scholars."*  
     *(Agreed upon)*  
   - When scholars are absent, ignorant leaders mislead others.
2. **Following Whims and Desires:**
   - Abandoning the Quran and Sunnah leads to following personal desires:  
     *"But if they do not respond to you – then know that they only follow their [own] desires."*  
     *(Surah Al-Qasas: 50)*  
3. **Fanatical Devotion to Ideas or Blind Following:**
   - Blind adherence to misguided leaders or ancestral traditions, even when contrary to Islamic teachings, leads to deviation:  
     *"And when it is said to them, 'Follow what Allah has revealed,' they say, 'Rather, we will follow that which we found our fathers doing.' "*  
     *(Surah Al-Baqarah: 170)*  
4. **Imitation of Corrupted Cultures and Beliefs:**
   - The Prophet (ﷺ) warned:  
     *"You will surely follow the ways of those who came before you..."*  
     *(Narrated by Abu Saeed; agreed upon)*  
   - This includes adopting beliefs and practices from non-Islamic cultures that contradict the Quran and Sunnah.
