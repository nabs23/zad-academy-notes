## Text of the Hadith
It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah رضي الله عنه said:  
*"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: 'The Shaytan comes to one of you and says: Who created such and such? Who created such and such? Until he says: Who created your Lord? If he goes that far, let him seek refuge with Allah and stop these thoughts.' "*  
*(Agreed upon)*  
 
According to another version:  
*"People will keep asking questions until they say: This is Allah, the Creator of all things, but who created Allah?"*  
*(Musnad Ahmad, sahih isnad)*  
 
In a similar report, the Prophet ﷺ said:  
*"If one of you experiences that, let him say: I believe in Allah and His Messengers, for that will take that thought away from his mind."*  
*(Abu Dawud, classified as hasan by al-Albani.)*
