Here’s a detailed breakdown of **"Tawhid is Islam, and it is the religion of all the messengers"** based on the text provided:

---

### **1. Tawhid as the Core of Islam**
- **Definition of Islam**:  
  Islam is the religion with which Allah sent His messengers and revealed His Books. It revolves around **affirming the oneness of Allah** by worshiping Him and submitting completely to Him.  

- **Evidence from the Qur’an**:  
  - *"Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam..."* ([Aal Imran 3:19](https://quran.com/3/19))  
  - *"And whoever desires other than Islam as religion – never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers."* ([Aal Imran 3:85](https://quran.com/3/85))

### **2. Tawhid as the Religion of All Messengers**
- **Prophet Nuh (Noah عليه السلام)**:  
  - *"And if you turn away [from my advice] then no payment have I asked of you. My reward is only from Allah, and I have been commanded to be of the Muslims."* ([Yunus 10:72](https://quran.com/10/72))  

- **Prophets Ibrahim (Abraham) and Yaqub (Jacob عليهم السلام)**:  
  - *"And who would be averse to the religion of Abraham except one who makes a fool of himself? ... Submit [in Islam] to the Lord of the worlds."* ([Al-Baqarah 2:130-132](https://quran.com/2/130))  

- **Prophet Yusuf (Joseph عليه السلام)**:  
  - *"Cause me to die a Muslim and join me with the righteous."* ([Yusuf 12:101](https://quran.com/12/101))  

- **Prophet Musa (Moses عليه السلام)**:  
  - *"O my people, if you have believed in Allah, then rely upon Him, if you should be Muslims."* ([Yunus 10:84](https://quran.com/10/84))  

- **Followers of Isa (Jesus عليه السلام)**:  
  - *"The disciples said, ‘We are supporters for Allah. We have believed in Allah and testify that we are Muslims [submitting to Him].’"* ([Aal Imran 3:52](https://quran.com/3/52))

### **3. Islam: One Religion with Different Laws**
- The **essence of religion** among all prophets was Tawhid (oneness of Allah).  
- Laws regarding specifics of worship and daily life differed across eras based on the needs of the people.  

- **The Prophet ﷺ explained**:  
  - *"The Prophets are like brothers born to co-wives; their mothers are different, but their religion is one."* (*Sahih al-Bukhari and Muslim*)  

- **Qur’anic Evidence**:  
  - *"To each of you We prescribed a law and a method..."* ([Al-Ma’idah 5:48](https://quran.com/5/48))  

---

### **4. The Incorrect Phrase: “Three Heavenly Religions”**
- The term "three heavenly religions" (referring to Islam, Judaism, and Christianity) is misleading and incorrect.  
- **Why it’s wrong**:  
  - It implies the validity of other religions besides Islam, whereas Allah ﷻ explicitly declared only **Islam** as the true religion.  
  - **Qur’anic Rebuttal**:  
    - *"Be Jews or Christians [so] you will be guided."* ([Al-Baqarah 2:135](https://quran.com/2/135))  
    - *"Those who say, 'We are Christians'."* ([Al-Ma’idah 5:82](https://quran.com/5/82))  

---

### **Key Takeaway**
The fundamental belief system of all messengers is one and the same—**Tawhid (oneness of Allah)**. While laws changed based on the circumstances of the people, the essential call to Islam and submission to Allah remained consistent.
