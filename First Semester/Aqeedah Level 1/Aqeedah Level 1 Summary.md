    - It is summarized in the declaration: _“Laa ilaaha illa Allah”_ (There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah).
- **Categories:**
    
    1. **_Tawhid ar-Rububiyah_ (Oneness of Lordship):** Allah is the Creator, Sustainer, and Sovereign.
    2. **_Tawhid al-Uluhiyah_ (Oneness of Worship):** Worship is directed to Allah alone.
    3. **_Tawhid al-Asma wa-Sifat_ (Oneness of Names and Attributes):** Allah’s names and attributes are affirmed without distortion or denial.
- **Centrality to Islam:**
    
    - Tawhid was the message of all Prophets.
    - It is the foundation of faith and the key to entering Paradise.

    - _Tangible Evidence:_
        - Answered prayers and divine help.
        - Miracles of the Prophets as definitive proof of Allah’s existence.
- **Logical Argument:**
    
    - Everything that exists must have a creator.
    - The Creator is Allah, who is eternal and self-sufficient.

## **8. Lessons from Disbelievers and Deviants**

- **Acknowledgment of Rububiyah:** Even disbelievers historically recognized Allah’s Lordship (e.g., as Creator), yet failed in worshipping Him alone.
