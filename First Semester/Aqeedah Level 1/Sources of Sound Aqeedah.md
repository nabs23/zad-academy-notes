### **1. The Noble Qur’an**  
The Qur’an is the primary source of sound aqeedah.  
- **Evidence from the Qur’an**:  
  - *“Follow, [O mankind], what has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow other than Him any allies.”* ([al-A’raf 7:3](https://quran.com/7/3))  
  - *“Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur’an and indeed, We will be its guardian.”* ([al-Hijr 15:9](https://quran.com/15/9))  
#### **Characteristics of the Qur’an**:  
1. Commands truth and forbids falsehood.  
2. Contains no contradictions; it is entirely sound and true.  
3. Protected from distortion and tampering.  
4. Judges between truth and falsehood (*Criterion - al-Furqan*).  
5. It is the definitive and decisive statement, far removed from falsehood.

### **2. The Sound Prophetic Sunnah**  
The Sunnah explains and complements the Qur’an. It consists of:  
- The sayings, actions, and approvals of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.  

#### **Evidence for the Authority of Sunnah**:  
1. *“And whatever the Messenger has given you – take; and what he has forbidden you – refrain from.”* ([al-Hashr 59:7](https://quran.com/59/7))  
2. *“And obey Allah and His Messenger, if you should be believers.”* ([al-Anfal 8:1](https://quran.com/8/1))  
3. *“And We revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them.”* ([an-Nahl 16:44](https://quran.com/16/44))  
4. Narrated by Abu Rafi’ رضي الله عنه: *“The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: I do not want to hear about a man to whom something I have said is conveyed, and he says, ‘We do not know this; we have the Book of Allah and this is not in it.’”* (*Classed as sahih by Ibn Hibban*)  

#### **Consensus of Scholars (Ijma’) on the Sunnah**:  
- Al-Irbad ibn Sariyah رضي الله عنه narrated: The Prophet ﷺ said:  
  *“I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the rightly-guided caliphs who come after me. Hold fast to it.”* (*Classed as sahih by at-Tirmidhi*)

### **3. The Consensus (Ijma’) of the Righteous Early Generations**  
- **Definition**: The consensus of the *Salaf* (early righteous generations).  
- The *Salaf* includes the Sahabah (Companions), Tabi’een (followers), and those who followed them in righteousness.  
- **Alternate Names for the Salaf**:  
  - Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jama’ah: Adhering to the Sunnah and unity.  
  - The Saved Sect: Those who follow the Sunnah and avoid innovations (*bid’ah*).  
  - The Prevailing Group: They will remain victorious until the Day of Judgment.  

#### **Evidence for Ijma’**:  
1. *“And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers – We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell.”* ([an-Nisa 4:115](https://quran.com/4/115))  
2. Narrated by Ibn Umar رضي الله عنه: *“Indeed Allah will not cause my ummah to agree on misguidance. The hand of Allah is with the main body of the Muslims (jama’ah).”* (*Classed as sahih by al-Albani*)

### **4. Reason (*‘Aql*)**  
- Reason is a supporting tool to understand and affirm aqeedah, but:  
  - It cannot independently derive the details of aqeedah.  
  - The Qur’an and Sunnah remain the definitive sources.  

#### **Ibn Taymiyyah’s Explanation**:  
- *“What is learned through sound reasoning cannot contradict the religious texts. Sound reasoning and clear texts go hand in hand.”*  

---

### **Key Principles**  
- If there is a contradiction between religious texts and reason, precedence is given to the texts because:  
  1. The texts are infallible and unchanging.  
  2. Reason can be influenced and is subject to change.
