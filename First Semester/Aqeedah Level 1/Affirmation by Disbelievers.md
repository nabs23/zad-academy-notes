### **How the Disbelievers and Polytheists Affirm Tawhid ar-Rububiyah**  

Even the disbelievers and polytheists affirm Tawhid ar-Rububiyah (Oneness of Lordship) in the sense that they recognize Allah as the Creator, Sovereign, and Sustainer of all things. However, this affirmation alone is not sufficient for salvation because they associate others with Allah in worship (Shirk).

### **Evidence of Their Affirmation in the Qur'an:**  

1. **They acknowledge Allah as the Creator:**  
   - **Qur'an:**  
     *"And if you asked them, 'Who created the heavens and earth?' they would surely say, 'Allah.'"*  
     ([Luqman 31:25](https://quran.com/31/25))  

2. **They affirm Allah's Sovereignty and Dominion:**  
   - **Qur'an:**  
     *"Say, 'In whose hand is the realm of all things – and He protects while none can protect against Him – if you should know?' They will say, 'All belongs to Allah.'"*  
     ([Al-Mu’minun 23:88-89](https://quran.com/23/88-89))  

3. **Even Iblees (Satan) affirmed Allah’s Lordship:**  
   - **Qur'an:**  
     *"[Iblees] said, 'My Lord, because You have put me in error…'"*  
     ([Al-Hijr 15:39](https://quran.com/15/39))  

4. **They recognize Allah's control of creation and natural phenomena:**  
   - **Qur'an:**  
     *"If you asked them, 'Who created the heavens and earth and subjected the sun and the moon?' they would surely say, 'Allah.' Then how are they deluded?"*  
     ([Al-Ankabut 29:61](https://quran.com/29/61))  

5. **They acknowledge Allah as the Provider and Sustainer:**  
   - **Qur'an:**  
     *"Say, 'Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and the dead out of the living and who arranges [every] matter?' They will say, 'Allah.'"*  
     ([Yunus 10:31](https://quran.com/10/31))

### **Key Understanding:**  
These verses show that disbelievers affirm the **oneness of Allah's Lordship** by recognizing Him as:  
- The Creator of all things.  
- The Sovereign who governs the universe.  
- The Provider who sustains creation.  

However, despite this acknowledgment, they do not single out Allah for worship, which leads them to Shirk (associating others with Allah).

### **Important Points:**  

1. **Tawhid ar-Rububiyah is not sufficient for salvation:**  
   - Merely believing in Allah’s Lordship does not make one a Muslim.  
   - **Qur'an:**  
     *"Indeed, they who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of Hell, abiding eternally therein. Those are the worst of creatures."*  
     ([Al-Bayyinah 98:6](https://quran.com/98/6))  

2. **True Tawhid includes Uluhiyah (Worship):**  
   - Ibn al-Qayyim explained:  
     *"Tawhid does not mean merely affirming that there is no Creator except Allah or that He is the Lord. Rather, Tawhid includes worshipping Him alone with sincere devotion, submitting to Him, and seeking His pleasure in all that one says and does."*

3. **Belief in Tawhid must be complete:**  
   - Affirming **Tawhid ar-Rububiyah** must lead to affirming **Tawhid al-Uluhiyah**—the oneness of worship.

### **Benefit:**  
The recognition of Allah's Lordship (Tawhid ar-Rububiyah) by disbelievers serves as a logical argument against them. If they believe that Allah alone creates, controls, and provides, then they should logically worship Him alone without associating partners.

In the next section, we will explore **Tawhid al-Uluhiyah**, which emphasizes singling out Allah in worship.
