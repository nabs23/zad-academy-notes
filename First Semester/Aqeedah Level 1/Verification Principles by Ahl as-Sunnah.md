### **1. Belief in and Submission to the Qur’an and Sunnah**  
- Ahl as-Sunnah believe in, submit to, and venerate the texts of the Qur’an and Sunnah.  
- They reject selective adherence, which is practiced by people of innovation and misguidance.  

#### **Evidence**:  
- a. *“It is not for a believing man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should [thereafter] have any choice about their affair.”* ([al-Ahzab 33:36](https://quran.com/33/36))  
- b. *“The only statement of the [true] believers when they are called to Allah and His Messenger to judge between them is that they say, ‘We hear and we obey.’”* ([an-Nur 24:51](https://quran.com/24/51))  
- c. *“Do not put [yourselves] before Allah and His Messenger, but fear Allah.”* ([al-Hujurat 49:1](https://quran.com/49/1))  
- d. *“But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves.”* ([an-Nisa 4:65](https://quran.com/4/65))

### **2. Comprehensive Understanding of Texts**  
- Ahl as-Sunnah examine **all texts** on a particular issue and reconcile them using sound methodology.  
- They avoid relying on ambiguous texts or distorting meanings.  

#### **Evidence**:  
- *“Take it easy, O people, for in this way the nations before you were doomed, because of their differing from their prophets and their quoting parts of the Books to contradict other parts.”* (*Narrated by Ahmad; sahih by al-Arna’ut*)

### **3. Holding Fast to the Qur’an and Sunnah**  
- The Qur’an and Sunnah are the ultimate sources of guidance and light.  
- Ahl as-Sunnah reject reliance on anything outside revelation, such as personal opinions or dreams.  

#### **Evidence**:  
- a. *“By which Allah guides those who pursue His pleasure to the ways of peace and brings them out from darkness into the light.”* ([al-Ma’idah 5:16](https://quran.com/5/16))  
- b. *“This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you.”* ([al-Ma’idah 5:3](https://quran.com/5/3))  
- c. *“And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things and as guidance and mercy.”* ([an-Nahl 16:89](https://quran.com/16/89))  
- d. *The Prophet ﷺ said: “I am leaving among you two weighty things: the first of them is the Book of Allah, in which is guidance and light. Follow the Book of Allah and hold fast to it.”* (*Narrated by Muslim*)

### **4. Following the Understanding of the Sahabah**  
- The Qur’an and Sunnah must be interpreted according to the understanding of the Sahabah.  
- Ahl as-Sunnah reject reinterpretations that contradict the Sahabah’s understanding.  

#### **Evidence**:  
- a. *“And whoever opposes the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers – We will drive him into Hell.”* ([an-Nisa 4:115](https://quran.com/4/115))  
- b. *“So if they believe in the same as you believe in, then they have been [rightly] guided.”* ([al-Baqarah 2:137](https://quran.com/2/137))  
- c. *“I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the way of the rightly-guided caliphs who come after me. Hold fast to it.”* (*Narrated by Ahmad*)  

---

### **5. Referring to the Arabic Language**  
- The language of the Qur’an and Sunnah is Arabic, and its meanings must be understood accordingly.  
- If unclear, one text should be used to explain another.  

#### **Evidence**:  
- *“Indeed, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an that you might understand.”* ([Yusuf 12:2](https://quran.com/12/2))  
- *“And thus We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an and have diversified therein the warnings.”* ([Ta-Ha 20:113](https://quran.com/20/113))  

---

### **Warnings Against Misinterpretation**  
- **The Bid’ah of Reinterpreting Texts**:  
  - Claim: Sahabah’s understanding was limited to their time, so texts should be interpreted differently today.  
  - Refuted by:  
    1. *“The best of you are my generation, then those who come after them.”* (*Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim*)  
    2. Reinterpreting texts distorts their meaning, similar to the deviations of previous nations.  
    3. *“For their breaking of the covenant We cursed them and made their hearts hard. They distort words from their [proper] usages.”* ([al-Ma’idah 5:13](https://quran.com/5/13))
