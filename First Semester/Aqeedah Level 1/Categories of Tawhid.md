### **Categories of Tawhid**  
The scholars have divided Tawhid into three categories based on the Qur'an and Sunnah. These categories define the different aspects of the Oneness of Allah and help in understanding the concept of Tawhid comprehensively.

---

### **1. Tawhid ar-Rububiyah (Oneness of Lordship)**  

#### **Definition:**  
- Tawhid ar-Rububiyah refers to the belief that Allah alone is the Lord (Rabb) of all creation.  
- This includes His roles as the **Creator**, **Sovereign**, and **Controller** of all that exists.  
- No one shares these attributes with Him.

---

#### **Aspects of Tawhid ar-Rububiyah:**  

1. **Allah as the Creator (Al-Khaliq):**  
   - Allah alone creates from nothing. No one else has this ability.  
   - **Qur'anic Evidence:**  
     - *"Unquestionably, His is the creation and the command; blessed is Allah, Lord of the worlds."* ([Al-A‘raf 7:54](https://quran.com/7/54))  
     - *"He is Allah, the Creator, the Inventor, the Fashioner."* ([Al-Hashr 59:24](https://quran.com/59/24))  

   - **Clarification:**  
     Some people might claim that others can "create." However, this only refers to transforming existing materials into something else (e.g., wood into furniture). True creation, which brings something into existence from nothing, belongs to Allah alone.

2. **Allah as the Sovereign (Al-Malik):**  
   - Allah alone owns and governs the entire universe.  
   - **Qur'anic Evidence:**  
     - *"Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion, and He is over all things competent."* ([Al-Mulk 67:1](https://quran.com/67/1))  
     - *"Say, 'O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and take sovereignty away from whom You will.'"* ([Aal Imran 3:26](https://quran.com/3/26))  

3. **Allah as the Controller (Al-Mudabbir):**  
   - Allah alone directs and manages the affairs of the universe.  
   - **Qur'anic Evidence:**  
     - *"He arranges [each] matter from the heaven to the earth."* ([As-Sajdah 32:5](https://quran.com/32/5))  
     - *"And then established Himself above the Throne, arranging the matter [of His creation]."* ([Yunus 10:3](https://quran.com/10/3))

#### **Additional Concepts Under Rububiyah:**  
1. **Giving Life and Death:**  
   - *"It is He who created death and life to test you."* ([Al-Mulk 67:2](https://quran.com/67/2))  

2. **Provision (Ar-Razzaq):**  
   - *"Indeed, those you worship besides Allah do not possess for you [the power of] provision. So seek from Allah provision and worship Him."* ([Al-Ankabut 29:17](https://quran.com/29/17))  

3. **Guidance and Victory:**  
   - *"Indeed, [O Muhammad], you do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills."* ([Al-Qasas 28:56](https://quran.com/28/56))

#### **Connection to Tawhid al-Uluhiyah:**  
Belief in **Tawhid ar-Rububiyah** naturally leads to **Tawhid al-Uluhiyah (Oneness of Worship)**.  
- If Allah is the sole Creator, Sovereign, and Controller, then He alone deserves to be worshiped.  
- **Qur'anic Evidence:**  
  - *"Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them – so worship Him and have patience for His worship."* ([Maryam 19:65](https://quran.com/19/65))

#### **Benefit:**  
**Believing in Tawhid ar-Rububiyah implies recognizing that worship (Uluhiyah) is due only to Allah.**
