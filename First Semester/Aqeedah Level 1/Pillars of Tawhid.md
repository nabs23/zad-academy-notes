### **The Pillars of Tawhid**  

Tawhid (the Oneness of Allah) has two essential pillars without which it cannot be established.
These pillars are:

---

### **1. Negation (An-Nafy):**  
- **Definition:**  
  Negation means rejecting and abandoning all forms of worship directed toward anything other than Allah.  
  - This includes idols, prophets, righteous people, nature, or any being other than Allah.  
  - It removes the idea that anyone or anything else has a right to be worshiped.  

- **Examples in Qur'an:**  
  - *"And We certainly sent into every nation a messenger, [saying], 'Worship Allah and avoid Taghut (false gods).'"* ([An-Nahl 16:36](https://quran.com/16/36))  
  - The words of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him):  
    *"Indeed, I am disassociated from that which you worship, except for He who created me."* ([Az-Zukhruf 43:26-27](https://quran.com/43/26-27))  

- **Explanation:**  
  Negation requires:
  - Disbelieving in Taghut (false gods or anything worshiped besides Allah).  
  - Recognizing that worship of anything other than Allah is invalid and a form of misguidance.

### **2. Affirmation (Al-Ithbat):**  
- **Definition:**  
  Affirmation is devoting all acts of worship sincerely to Allah alone, as prescribed in the Qur’an and Sunnah.  
  - It confirms that Allah is the only One deserving of worship.  

- **Examples in Qur'an:**  
  - *"Worship Allah [alone] and associate nothing with Him."* ([An-Nisa 4:36](https://quran.com/4/36))  
  - *"So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold."* ([Al-Baqarah 2:256](https://quran.com/2/256))  

- **Explanation:**  
  Affirmation requires:  
  - Declaring Allah as the only deity worthy of worship.  
  - Directing every act of servitude, obedience, and worship to Him alone.  

---

### **Combination of Negation and Affirmation:**  
- The **word of Tawhid**, *Laa ilaaha illa Allah* (there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah), combines both pillars:  
  - **Negation:** *Laa ilaaha* (there is no god).  
  - **Affirmation:** *illa Allah* (except Allah).  

- These two aspects must come together for belief in Tawhid to be valid. Simply affirming Allah’s existence without rejecting false gods is incomplete, and rejecting false gods without affirming Allah’s worship is insufficient.

### **Religious Texts Supporting the Two Pillars:**  
1. *"Worship Allah and avoid Taghut."* ([An-Nahl 16:36](https://quran.com/16/36))  
2. *"That you not worship except Allah."* ([Hud 11:26](https://quran.com/11/26))  
3. *"And whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah..."* ([Al-Baqarah 2:256](https://quran.com/2/256))

### **The Danger of Misinterpreting Freedom of Belief**
- The concept of absolute religious freedom (allowing people to worship anything without accountability) contradicts Tawhid.  
- Belief in Tawhid obligates a person to:
  - Reject all forms of Taghut.
  - Acknowledge the falseness of any religion or belief system apart from Islam.  

- **Key Principle:**  
  Absolute freedom of belief, which promotes acceptance of all forms of worship as valid, undermines the essence of Tawhid. True Tawhid demands rejecting disbelief (kufr) and affirming Allah’s oneness exclusively.

---

This understanding of **negation and affirmation** emphasizes the comprehensive nature of Tawhid, requiring both the rejection of falsehood and the affirmation of Allah’s exclusive right to be worshiped.
