### **1. Well-Being in This World and the Hereafter**
- **Evidence**:  
  *“Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer – We will surely cause him to live a good life, and We will surely give them their reward [in the Hereafter] according to the best of what they used to do.”* ([an-Nahl 16:97](https://quran.com/16/97))  

- **Commentary by Ibn al-Qayyim**:  
  - Tawhid and sincerity are like a tree in the heart, with good deeds as its branches and a good life as its fruit.  
  - In contrast, shirk, hypocrisy, and showing off bring fear, anxiety, and darkness in this world, with torment in the Hereafter.

- **The Supplication of Dhul-Noon (Prophet Yunus عليه السلام)**:
