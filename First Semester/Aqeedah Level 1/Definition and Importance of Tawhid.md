### **1. Linguistic Definition**
- The word *Tawhid* is derived from the root **wahhada**, meaning "to make something one."

### **2. Islamic Terminology**
- Tawhid means attributing to Allah that which is uniquely His in terms of:  
  - **Divinity** (Uluhiyyah).  
  - **Lordship** (Rububiyyah).  
  - **Names and Attributes** (Asma’ wa Sifat).  
- It affirms that Allah is:  
  - **Unique** and has no partners in His characteristics.  
  - No one, no matter their status, shares in His qualities or deserves worship alongside Him.  

### **3. Conditions of Sound Belief in Tawhid**
- Belief in Tawhid must meet three conditions:
  1. **Affirmation in the heart.**  
  2. **Utterance on the tongue.**  
  3. **Implementation in actions.**  

- **Quote**: Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab said:  
  *"There is no scholarly difference that belief in Tawhid must be affirmed in the heart, on the tongue, and in one's actions. If any of these three is missing, then that person cannot be a Muslim."*
