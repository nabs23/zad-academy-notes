When presenting the existence of Allah to non-believers or those who reject religious texts, it is essential to use logical, natural, and tangible evidence. This approach provides a strong basis for affirming belief in Allah. Below are the three types of evidence mentioned:

### **1. Evidence of Innate Human Nature (Fitrah):**  

- **Definition of Fitrah:**  
  Every human being is born with an innate disposition to believe in a Creator. This natural inclination does not require external teaching or experience to manifest.

- **Prophetic Statement:**  
  *"Every child is born in a state of fitrah, then his parents make him into a Jew or a Christian or a Zoroastrian."*  
  (Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim)

- **Supporting Qur’anic Verses:**  
  - *"So direct your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created [all] people."*  
    ([Ar-Rum 30:30](https://quran.com/30/30))  
  - When people are in distress, they instinctively call upon Allah, as mentioned in:  
    *"When adversity touches you at sea, lost are [all] those you invoke except for Him."*  
    ([Al-Isra 17:67](https://quran.com/17/67))  

- **Explanation:**  
  - This instinctive turn to Allah in times of hardship demonstrates the deeply rooted nature of belief in Allah.  
  - Fitrah is so strong that no external force can completely erase it.

### **2. Evidence of Reason and Common Sense:**  

- **Logical Proof:**  
  The existence of a Creator is supported by the reasoning that every creation must have a Creator. For instance:  
  - The presence of a camel implies that someone has left it there.  
  - Similarly, the vast heavens, earth, and their intricate systems point to the existence of an All-Knowing Creator.  

- **Qur’anic Evidence:**  
  *"Or were they created by nothing, or were they the creators [of themselves]? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather, they are not certain."*  
  ([At-Tur 52:35-36](https://quran.com/52/35-36))

- **Two Possibilities (with no third):**  
  1. The universe was created by nothing (impossible and illogical).  
  2. The universe created itself (also impossible, as non-existent entities cannot create).  

- **Result:**  
  The only logical conclusion is that the universe was created by Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.  

- **Historical Example:**  
  A scholar debated with atheists, claiming he arrived late because a boat without a helmsman brought him across the river. The atheists were astounded by the absurdity of this claim, to which the scholar replied:  
  *"If you cannot believe a boat moves without a helmsman, how can you deny the existence of a Creator for this universe?"*

### **3. Tangible, Visible Evidence:**  

This evidence is based on visible phenomena that point to Allah’s existence:  

#### **A. Answered Prayers and Relief in Hardship:**  
- **Evidence in the Qur’an:**  
  - *"Is He [not best] who responds to the desperate one when he calls upon Him and removes evil and makes you inheritors of the earth?"*  
    ([An-Naml 27:62](https://quran.com/27/62))  
  - The prophets’ supplications, such as those of Nuh (AS) and Musa (AS), were answered as proof of Allah’s existence and support.

- **Explanation:**  
  Even today, those who call upon Allah in sincerity witness their prayers being answered, reinforcing belief in Him.  

#### **B. The Miracles of the Prophets:**  
- **Examples from the Qur’an:**  
  1. **Musa (AS):**  
     - *"Strike with your staff the sea," and it parted, leaving twelve dry pathways.*  
       ([Ash-Shu'ara 26:63](https://quran.com/26/63))  
  2. **Isa (AS):**  
     - Bringing the dead to life by Allah’s permission.  
       ([Aal-Imran 3:49](https://quran.com/3/49))  
  3. **Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ):**  
     - Splitting of the moon as a sign for the Quraysh.  
       ([Al-Qamar 54:1-2](https://quran.com/54/1-2))  

- **Explanation:**  
  These miracles are extraordinary events beyond human capability, proving the existence of Allah, Who sent these Prophets.

### **Further Evidence Based on Reason: Reflection and Contemplation**  
Reflecting on the intricate systems of the universe — from the heavens, earth, and mountains to rivers, plants, and animals — reveals the signs of an all-powerful Creator.  

- **Qur’anic Evidence:**  
  *"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, and the [great] ships which sail through the sea... are signs for a people who use reason."*  
  ([Al-Baqarah 2:164](https://quran.com/2/164))  

---

### **Summary:**  
The existence of Allah is supported by:  
1. **Innate Human Nature (Fitrah):** Natural inclination to turn to Allah.  
2. **Reason and Common Sense:** Logical conclusions drawn from the existence of the universe and its systems.  
3. **Tangible Evidence:** Answered prayers and miracles of the Prophets.  

These proofs provide a comprehensive foundation for belief in Allah, beyond reliance on religious texts alone.
