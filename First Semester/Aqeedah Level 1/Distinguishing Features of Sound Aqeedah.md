Back: [[Aqeedah Level 1]]

Sound Islamic aqeedah stands apart from false beliefs and innovations (*bid’ah*) due to the following characteristics:

1. **Clarity and Simplicity**  
   - It is straightforward and free of complexity.  
   - There is nothing mysterious or exclusive to a specific group (e.g., clergy).  

2. **Harmony with Human Nature**  
   - It aligns with common sense and innate human nature (*fitrah*).  
   - It does not contradict natural inclinations.  

3. **Unchanging and Timeless**  
   - Sound aqeedah does not alter over time.  
   - It is free from additions, subtractions, distortions, or the influence of rulers or monks.  

4. **Based on Clear Proof and Evidence**  
   - Every aspect is supported by strong proof and arguments from the Qur’an and Sunnah.  
   - Example from Qur’an:  
     - *“With Allah is the far-reaching argument.”* ([al-An’am 6:149](https://quran.com/6/149))  

5. **Moderation**  
   - It is balanced and avoids both extremes: exaggeration (*ghuluww*) and negligence.
