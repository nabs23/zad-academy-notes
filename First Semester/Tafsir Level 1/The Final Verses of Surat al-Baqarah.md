- Narrated in Sahih Muslim:  
  *Jibreel (AS) said to the Prophet ﷺ, “Glad tidings of two lights that have been given to you and were never given to any prophet before you: the Opening of the Book (Surat al-Fatihah) and the closing verses of Surat al-Baqarah. You will never recite one letter of them except that you will be given (reward).”*

### **Translation of the Verses (2:284-286)**  

**[2:284]**  
*"To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Whether you show what is within yourselves or conceal it, Allah will bring you to account for it. Then He will forgive whom He wills and punish whom He wills, and Allah is over all things competent."*  

**[2:285]**  
*"The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and [so have] the believers. All of them have believed in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers, [saying], 'We make no distinction between any of His messengers.' And they say, 'We hear and we obey. [We seek] Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the [final] destination.'"*  

**[2:286]**  
*"Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has earned. 'Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Lord, and lay not upon us a burden like that which You laid upon those before us. Our Lord, and burden us not with that which we have no ability to bear. And pardon us; and forgive us; and have mercy upon us. You are our protector, so give us victory over the disbelieving people.'”*
