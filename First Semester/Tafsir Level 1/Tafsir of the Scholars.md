    - **Arabic language** and its meanings.  
    - Independent reasoning based on sound scholarly principles.

## **Activities**

### **1. Give a brief description of methodologies of tafsir.**
- **Answer**:  
  - Tafsir is based on the Qur'an itself, the Sunnah, the words of the Sahabah and Tabi’een, and linguistic analysis. Scholars use these sources to interpret verses and, when necessary, employ independent reasoning grounded in sound principles.

### **2. How can the scholars explain the Qur'an through the Qur'an? Is it possible to explain the Qur'an on the basis of personal opinion?**
- **Answer**:  
  - Scholars explain the Qur'an through the Qur'an by using one verse to clarify another.  
  - Explaining the Qur'an based on **personal opinion** without adhering to Islamic principles is impermissible and leads to misinterpretation. Valid tafsir must rely on authentic sources and sound methodology.
