- **Definition**:  
  - Tafsir of the Qur'an by the Qur'an involves explaining certain parts of the Qur'an using other parts.  
  - Some verses are clear (**muhkamat**), while others require explanation (**mutashabihat**), which is provided within the Qur'an itself.

- **Examples**:
  1. **Surah Al-Qari'ah (101:1-4)**:  
     *"The Striking Calamity. What is the Striking Calamity? And what can make you know what is the Striking Calamity? It is the Day when people will be like moths, dispersed."*  
     - The initial ambiguity about "The Striking Calamity" is clarified in the subsequent verses.
     
  2. **Surah Al-Ma'arij (70:19-21)**:  
     *"Indeed, mankind was created anxious. When evil touches him, impatient. And when good touches him, withholding [of it]."*  
     - The term **"anxious" (haloo ø)"** is clarified by explaining human traits of impatience and miserliness.

- **Significance**:  
  - This method is the first and most reliable method of tafsir, as it ensures the explanation is directly from the Qur'an itself.
