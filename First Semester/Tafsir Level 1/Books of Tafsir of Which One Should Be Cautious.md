## **Books of Tafsir of Which One Should Be Cautious**

### **1. Al-Kashf wa’l-Bayan ‘an Tafsir al-Qur’an**  
- **Author**:  
  - Abu Ishaq Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ath-Tha’labi.  
  - Died in **427 AH**.  

- **Issues with this Tafsir**:  
  - Frequently quotes reports from **Jewish sources (Isra’iliyyat)** without critique.  
  - Contains **fabricated hadiths** about the virtues of specific surahs, often attributed to Ubay ibn Ka'b.  
  - Narrates fabricated Shia hadiths without distinguishing them as false.  

- **Note from Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah**:  
  - *"Ath-Tha’labi was good and religiously committed, but he lacked knowledge of sound and fabricated hadiths, narrating whatever he found without verification."*

### **2. Ruh al-Ma’ani fi Tafsir al-Qur’an al-Azeem wa’s-Sab’ al-Mathani**  
- **Author**:  
  - Abu’l-Thana’ Shihab ad-Deen as-Sayyid Mahmoud Afandi al-Alusi.  
  - Died in **1270 AH**.  

- **Overview**:  
  - A vast encyclopedic tafsir referencing many works, including those of:  
    - Abu’s-Su’ud, al-Baydawi, al-Fakhr ar-Razi, Ibn Atiyyah, Abu Hayyan, az-Zamakhshari, and Ibn Kathir.  

- **Problem**:  
  - The author shows significant interest in **Sufi symbolism**:  
    - After explaining the apparent meaning, he delves into hidden meanings based on Sufi interpretations.  
    - Quotes from figures like al-Junayd, Ibn Ataa, and Abu’l-Abbas al-Mursi, which are considered **far from the truth** by mainstream scholars.

2. **What do you know about tafsir based on Sufi symbolism, and why is it blameworthy?**  
   - **Tafsir based on Sufi symbolism** often seeks hidden meanings disconnected from the apparent meaning of the text.  
   - It is blameworthy because it leads to interpretations far removed from the truth and unsupported by evidence.
