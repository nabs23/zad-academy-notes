- **Definition**:  
  - The Tabi’een learned tafsir from the Sahabah (RA), following the same methodology of explaining the Qur'an by:
    1. The Qur'an itself.  
    2. The Sunnah.  
    3. Linguistic analysis and context.

- **Example from the Tabi’een**:  
  - **Surah At-Tur 52:21**:  
    *"And those who believed and whose descendants followed them in faith – We will join with them their descendants, and We will not deprive them of anything of their deeds."*  
    - **Explanation by Sa’eed ibn Jubayr**:  
      - Allah will elevate the offspring of believers to the level of their parents in Paradise, even if the offspring's deeds are of a lower rank.  
      - This is a gracious favor from Allah, bringing joy to the parents.
