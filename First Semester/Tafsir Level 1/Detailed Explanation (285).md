### **Detailed Explanation (2:285)**  

1. **[The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and [so have] the believers...]**  
   - The **Messenger ﷺ** believed in all that was revealed to him, including the **Qur'an and Sunnah**. This belief is not mere acknowledgment but includes acceptance, compliance, and adherence to the rulings.  
   - The **Sahabah** also shared this belief and followed the teachings of Islam fully.  
   - Example: Abu Talib believed in the Prophet ﷺ but did not accept Islam or adhere to its teachings, so his belief did not benefit him.  

2. **Belief in Allah's Lordship (Rububiyyah)**:  
   - **General Lordship**: Allah is the Creator and Sustainer of all creation.  
     > *(Lord of the worlds)* [Al-Fatihah: 1].  
   - **Specific Lordship**: Allah is the Sustainer of the believers specifically, guiding and caring for them.  
     > *(Our Lord, give us in this world that which is good...)* [2:201].  
   - **Most Specific Lordship**: Allah is the Lord and Sustainer of the Prophets.  
     > *(The Lord of Moses and Aaron)* [7:122].  

3. **[All of them have believed in Allah, His angels, His books, and His messengers...]**  
   - **Belief in Allah**: Includes belief in His existence, rububiyyah (lordship), uluhiyyah (divinity), and asma' wa sifat (names and attributes).  
   - **Belief in Angels**: Belief in their existence, roles, and functions as described in the Qur'an and Sunnah.  
   - **Belief in Books**: Belief in all revealed books, such as the Qur'an, Torah, Zabur, Injil, and the scriptures of Ibrahim and Musa.  
   - **Belief in Messengers**: Belief in all the prophets without distinction; rejecting one is akin to rejecting all.  

4. **[We make no distinction between any of His messengers]**  
   - The Muslims do not differentiate between messengers as the People of the Book did, who believed in some and rejected others.  

5. **[And they say, 'We hear and we obey']**  
   - This shows the believers' attitude of submission to Allah's commands, contrasting with previous nations who disobeyed.  
   - The Muslim's response to Allah’s commands should always be **hearing and obeying**, which reflects true faith.  

6. **[We seek Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the [final] destination]**  
   - Recognition that humans will inevitably fall short, and so they continually ask for Allah's forgiveness.  
   - Acknowledges that all deeds will ultimately be judged by Allah on the Day of Judgment.
