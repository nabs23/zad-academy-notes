## **Explanation of Verse: [It is You we worship and You we ask for help]**

### **Key Concepts**
1. **[It is You we worship]**  
   - **Definition of Worship (ʿIbadah)**:  
     - Includes everything Allah loves and is pleased with, in both outward actions (e.g., prayer) and inward actions (e.g., sincerity).  
   - **Slave (ʿAbd)**:  
     - The one who complies with what the One Who is worshipped wants, based on religious texts.  
     - Worship must be:  
       1. **Sincere for Allah’s sake**.  
       2. **In accordance with the teachings of the Messenger ﷺ**.

2. **[And You we ask for help]**  
   - Seeking aid (isti’aanah) involves relying on Allah for:  
     - Bringing benefit.  
     - Warding off harm.  
   - **Trust in Allah (Tawakkul)**:  
     - Placing reliance on Allah with complete obedience to Him.  

3. **Phrase Structure**:  
   - The placement of **iyyaka** (it is You) before **naʿbudu** (we worship) emphasizes exclusivity in worshipping Allah alone.  
   - The essence of religion is summed up in two concepts:  
     1. Worship (ʿIbadah).  
     2. Trust in Allah (Tawakkul).

### **Benefits and Lessons**
- **Unity of Worship and Seeking Help**:  
  - Worship requires Allah’s guidance, and help is needed to fulfill worship.  
  - Al-Fatihah emphasizes monotheism (Tawheed) and disavowal of shirk (associating partners with Allah).  

- **Shifting from Third to Second Person**:  
  - The shift to addressing Allah directly emphasizes closeness after praising Him.  

- **What We Learn from the Verse**:  
  1. Worship requires Allah’s help to avoid conceit and ensure sincerity.  
  2. Relying on anyone besides Allah for matters of worship is impermissible.  
  3. The phrase **"we worship"** refutes the belief that humans lack free will (Jabari view).  
  4. The individual cannot act without Allah’s will, refuting the Qadari view that denies Allah’s control over human actions.  
  5. Help should be sought exclusively from Allah in matters only He can control.
